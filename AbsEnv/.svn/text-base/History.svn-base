        I have added new CfgEnv sub-environment to AbsEnv. This is 
        going to replace BdbConfigEnv, but during the migration both
        will be present here. BdbConfigEnv will be removed once
        migration is complete. 

V00-05-01 --------------------------------------------------------

V00-04-20 --------------------------------------------------------

27th March 2003: Stephen J. Gowdy
	Don't use a pointer value being 0 to deterine if the set
	methods have been called previously, now check a local variable
	(this means you should only have one AbsEnv person job, but
	that should be the case currently).

V00-04-19 --------------------------------------------------------
