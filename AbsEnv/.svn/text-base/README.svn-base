AbsEnv package
Coordinator: Stephen J. Gowdy

Contains the "Reconstruction Environment", which is used by various
reconstruction modules to obtain what they need re histogramming support,
calibration access, etc.

Depends on:
  BaBar, ProxyDict and RogueWave

Depended on by:
  FrameExample for ParmExample files
  GenEnv EmcEnv SvtEnv TrkEnv IfrEnv DrcEnv DchEnv PepEnv
	.. and almost everyone else.


Base Classes:
  AbsEnv   -  root class of the "environment" tree used by reconstruction
              modules to find geometry, constants, etc.

  AbsDetEnv - Abstract detector environment
  AbsDetIndex - Abstract detector index
  AbsDetIndexFactory - this can be used to make AbsDetIndexs (this is abstract)
  AbsDetStructure - hold the list of AbsDetIndexs for a AbsDetEnv and
			answers questions about them (this is mostly abstract)
  AbsDetStructureIterator - iterators over itsChannels of AbsDetStructure
  AbsConcreteIndexFactory - will do a simple construction
  AbsEnvDataHolder - an abstract dataholder for use in the environment
  ThreeCoordIndex - a three coord index (implementation of AbsDetIndex)
  TwoCoordIndex - a two coord index (implementation of AbsDetIndex)


The following are now in Framework
  AbsParm  -  used by modules to obtain and access parameter values
              (See also ParmExample in FrameExample/)
  AbsParmDouble - To hold a "double" parameter
  AbsParmBool   - To hold a "bool" parameter
  AbsParmFilename - To hold a "filename", which is a string that
                    is converted to a pathname by searching for a 
                    file.
  AbsParmGeneral - To hold a templated class as a parameter. Must be
		    able to be read from a stream using >>.
  AbsParmIfdStrKey - To hold a secondary key for accesing the Event.
		     This is an IfdStrKey that is produced from a
		     string read in through Tcl.
