AbsEvent package
Coordinator: Bob Jacobsen

The AbsEvent class is the central repository of "event related"
data in BaBar reconstruction code.  Other classes in this package
are base classes for various data classes that are included in the
event.

Depends on:
  AbsParm class depends on Framework

Depended on by:
  DbiEvent inherits from this. 
  Framework depends on this through DbiEvent

Interesting Classes:
  AbsEvent    -  Central repository of event related info.  DO NOT
		change this class, as its no longer necessary to do so.

  AbsEvtObj   - Used as a base by all objects (classes) in an event,
                it defines some common bookkeeping behavior

  AbsGHit     - Common base for all "Geant3 Hit" classes, defines
                time shifting common function for mixing
