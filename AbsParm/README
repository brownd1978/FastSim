This package has some AbsParms in it.  It would have been nice for
all AbsParms to land here, but history and coupling with the Framework
led to them being in Framework/  The AbsParms that are here are
here now because they use Roguewave and RW clssses can not be used
in the FW package.  It would be nice to migrate the rest of the AbsParms
here, but that is not a high priority.

AbsParmVector:
	An AbsParm that has a vector of values.
	Vector returned is an RWTValOrderedVector

AbsParmNamedValue
AbsParmNamedObject:
	AbsParms that associates names (strings) with objects.
	End user can set the TCL value as one of the names, and the
	AppModule can get the correct object (pointer) from this.

	The objects are owned by the original user (AppModule), NOT
	by this class.	AbsParmNamedValue stores by value (copying the
	original object) and should be used with "simple" things like
	enums, floats, etc.  AbsParmNamedObject stores a pointer to the
	original object.

	The dump and restore actions operate on the name strings, not
	on the underlying objects.  It is possible for an association
	to be changed in the using AppModule's source code.
