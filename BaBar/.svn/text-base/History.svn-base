History, latest first:
----------------------
2010.01.21 stroili
	split code in src and include directories
2008.01.10 kelsey V00-11-09
	Add SIGRTMAX fixes for MacOSX only (no effect elsewhere)
2007.09.14 kelsey V00-11-08
	Bug fix for MacOSX gcc 3.3 <cmath> leaves isnan() undefined.
	NOTE:  Only incremently lowest digit as doesn't change linkages for
	any production platforms.  Why confuse people?	
2006.12.08 ads V00-11-07
        Fix for gcc 3.4.6.  (missing math.h include file in testBaBar.cc)
2005.03.09 gowdy V00-11-06
	Don't include unwanted changes at the HEAD that were pulled
	into the last tag by mistake.
2005.02.21 narsky V00-11-05
	Introduced std::count_if on Solaris, similar to std::count
	and std::distance introduced by Rainer earlier.
2004.11.09 sjg V00-11-02
	Change one more Sun variables that are checked to __SUNPRO_CC.
	Also adjust BaBar.cc/hh as the function inside is a template.
	Fix definition in BaBar.cc for std::distance.
2004.09.20 sjg V00-06-09
	Update hack in V00-06-08 for the SL3 instead of RHEL3.
2004.09.20 sjg V00-11-01
	Change various Sun variables that are checked to __SUNPRO_CC.
2004.09.16 sjg V00-06-08
	Add a kludge to allow linking builds on RHEL3 build with gcc 2.95.3
	and using external packages build on RH72.
2004.09.15 RB V00-11-00
	Remove abs() kludge for both Linux and Sun. testBaBar.cc now
	uses fabs().
2004.09.14 sjg
	Define ENODATA and O_LARGEFILE on the Mac. These are not
	defined there.
2004.09.09 sjg
	Make abs patch available to gcc3 too.
	Fix the testBaBar.t file that I had overwritten on the 11th Aug 04.
2004.08.24 RB
	Remove the obsolete BaBar/Experiment.hh header. (This exists
	as Experiment/Experiment.hh.)
2004.08.20 RB
	Introduce emulations of the C++-standard forms of std::count
	and std::distance for Solaris.
2004.08.11 sjg
	Remove the old extraction and insertion operators and getline
	function which were needed for Classic IOstreams on Solaris. Add
	some tests to make sure we have them now.
2004.08.04 sjg
	Actually, we believe nothing in BaBar.hh is needed just now in VXWORKS
	so move the clock_t thing outside of VXWORKS scope too.
2004.08.04 sjg
	Reduce the exposure of BaBar.hh to VXWORKS to allow it to be used
	in dataflow.
2004.05.08 sjg
	Fix some warnings from BbrTime and its test. Aslo remove these
	as I don't think they are used.
2003.08.13 sjg
	General tidy.
	Removed defining HAS_BUILTIN_BOOL as this is not used anywhere.
	Removed abs() patch for Sun CC < 5.0 (we've not used this for
	a whlie).
	Remove declaration of regex and regcmp, these were removed
	a few days ago (2003.07.21 below).
	Add comment on when iostreams block should be removed.
2003.08.12 sjg
	Remove duplicate block in BaBar.hh for supporting RW migration on
	Solaris.
2003.08.11 sjg
	Add definition of __CMATH__ inside the abs patch for gcc 2.95.3 to
	avoid (incorrect in one case) refdefinition of these in <cmath>.
2003.07.21 RB
        Remove the unused reg.cc.
2003.04.22 sjg
	Remove support for old clock_gettime which is now supported.
	Remove support for OSF and remove bool hacks.
2002.09.30 echarles
	In BaBar.hh
	Moved the other definition of abs(long double)) {the one for Sun}
2002.06.17 echarles
	In BaBar.hh
	Moved the definition of abs(long double)) next to the definition of
	abs(long long) and inside a block that is protected for CINT processing.
	This is required b/c CINT doesn't seem to be able to handle long double.
2002.03.07 ryd V00-05-40
        Forward declaring std::string and declare i/o operators for
        std::string
2002.02.10 ads V00-05-38
	Added 
	istream& getline(istream& is, std::string& str, char delim = '\n')
	to BaBar.hh and BabarStringUtils.cc.
2002.02.07 ryd V00-05-37
	Moved i/o operators for string to BaBar.hh
2002.02.01 ads V00-05-36
	Removed hash from BabarStringUtils.*.
2002.01.19 ryd V00-05-35
        Removed the BaBarStdStringFwd.hh file as no longer needed. 
2002.01.15 ryd V00-05-34
        The 'clock_t' hack is now invoke if the following is
        succeeds:
        defined(SUNCC)&&defined(_XOPEN_SOURCE)&&( _XOPEN_SOURCE - 0 == 500 )
        This allows this fix to be picked up by the ddl compiler.
2002.01.07 ryd V00-05-33 
        Added BaBarStdStringFwd.hh to allow forward declaration
        of string in ddl files. The ddl compiler can not process
        the string header on Linux.
        Added BaBarStringUtils.{cc,hh} which defines a hash function
        for the standard string, and defines the I/O operators of 
        std::string on the classic streams.

2002.01.04 ryd V00-05-32
        Added definition of clock_t for SunOS58 to work around 
        problem with unix98 compliance in the string header (gpdf)

2001.11.15 gpdf	V00-05-31
	Added declaration of strsignal() for Solaris when Unix95/98
	compilation is enabled.  Slightly modified _definition_ of
	strsignal() for OSF to add error checking.
	[History BaBar.hh strsignal.cc]

2001.09.27 sjg	[History entry by gpdf, 2001.11.15]
	The IS_OPEN macro is no longer needed, linux now has the same 
	interface as other compiliers (rdbuf()->is_open()). I've also 
	removed a RW define in the same code block. That may be needed so 
	we should watch the nightly after this goes in.
	[BaBar.hh]

2001.09.07 gpdf	V00-05-30
	Removed definitions of _IOEOF and _IOERR for Linux.  These are
	implementation-specific non-POSIX names that happened to have
	been used in OprLogManager for historical reasons.  They have
	been removed from there (OprLogManager V00-05-19) and can now be
	removed from here as well.
	[History BaBar.hh]

2001.08.30 gpdf	V00-05-29
	Removed definition of WIFCONTINUED.  Protected against redefinition
	of CLOCK_REALTIME.  Modified our special value of CLOCK_REALTIME on
	Linux to be consistent with that supplied from ACE.  (It's zero.)
	Removed reference to IfdHepAList from testBaBar.{cc,t}.
	[History BaBar.hh testBaBar.{cc,t}]

2001.08.29 ads V00-05-28
	Removed definition of IfdHepAList from BaBar.hh.

2001.08.02 ads V00-05-27
	Removed definitions of APPMODULERETURN(TYPE|VAL)(1|2).

2001.01.30 gpdf V00-05-26
	Protect some of the new standards-oriented code in BaBar.hh from
	ROOT's CINT, which doesn't seem able to handle it.  Reorder some
	code so that Stephen's V00-05-24 addition and my additions work
	correctly together.
	[History BaBar.hh]

2001.01.29 gpdf gpdf-20010129, V00-05-25
	Remove several Linux kludges (SEM_A, SEM_R, inappropriate non-Sun
	use of "_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS", SIGEMT, SIG_DEF) now that user
	code has been modified not to use these non-standard constructs.
	Add an executable that can be used to diagnose the state of the
	various standard feature-test macros such as POSIX_C_SOURCE
	(testStandards.cc).  Add a #define of BABAR_socklen_t to allow
	network code to be written uniformly across our platforms, which
	differ in their level of adoption of Unix98's networking API.
	[History GNUmakefile BaBar.hh]

2001.01.24 gowdy V00-05-24
	Add large file support definitions for Sun.

2000.11.28 echarles
        Protected 1 line that use timespec with #ifndef __CINT__ directives

2000.11.21 echarles
        Protected 4 lines that use long long with #ifndef __CINT__ directives
        to allow building CINT dictionaries of BaBar code.  
        Added LIBEXTRARDLFILES to GNUmakefile so that BbrEventId and Constants
        are built into this package's dictionary

2000.11.14 sjg
	glibc 2.1.3 now has SIGSYS. Check for it being defined before
	defining it.

2000.10.27 sjg
	Removed support for glibc 2.0 and updated support for glibc 2.2.

2000.07.10 sjg
	Updated BaBar.hh and BaBarBoolKludge.cc to work on Solaris 6 and 7.

2000.05.01 BobJ BbrShell is now OprShell, maintained by OPR, so 
        it has been removed from the BaBar package

99.11.01 gpdf	for V00-05-15
	Patched in strsignal() for Compaq/OSF.  Implemented as function
	returning element from __sys_siglist[].  Followed pattern of
	clock_gettime() in how to set up conditional compilation.  Per
	agreement with SG. 
	[History BaBar.hh; new: strsignal.cc]

99.06.28 sjg
	Fix logic in isastream.

99.06.14 sjg
	Implement regcmp and regex.

99.06.06 sjg
	Added declarations of regcmp and regex which are missing on
	Linux. Added semctl.cc to forward call and add arguement, only
	does something on Linux (compiles, I'll need to see if it
	actually links). Will add implementations of regcmp and
	regex using regcomp and regexec later.

99.06.06 sjg
	Added new block for problems with Linux in BaBar.hh.
	Added new file which impliements clock_gettime for Linux only.

99.05.18 samuel & sjg
	Added BaBarBoolKludge.cc for Sun optimised.

99.05.10 sjg
	Updated abs patch to apply to linux also. The [u]int64_t is now
	identical for all platforms.
	Updated test program to test more of BaBar.hh.
	Updated test program after feedback from Gregory.

99.05.10 samuel
	Changed definition of [u]int64_t for Sun platform to explicit
	typedef instead of including sys/int_types.h. Added test
	program testBaBar to test these types, and regression test.

99.05.07 samuel
	Added int64_t and uint64_t types to BaBar.hh. On Sun, these
	are defined by #include <sys/int_type.h>, while on OSF, they
	are typedef'ed explicitly.

99.01.29 A. De Silva
	Moved APPMODULE* macros from Framework into BaBar.hh

98.01.22 gpdf
	Changed "Linking" message for test program in GNUmakefile to add
	package name to conform to new standard (meant to ease parsing of
	build logs for errors).

97.12.22 gpdf (subsequent commit)
	Changed the definitions of d_Char and d_Octet from "signed char" to
	plain "char" to conform to the definitions used in the Objectivity
	header files.  This does mean that the signedness of these types may
	vary from platform to platform.  Not ideal, but better than the
	alternative of types incompatible with Objectivity.

97.12.22 gpdf
	Prepared for use as a "dual-use" DataFlow/offline package. Added
	link_BaBar.mk to conform to standard.  Added BaBarODMGTypes.h, 
	with contents copied from HepODBMS/odbms/HepODMGTypes.h and changed
	to make them more stand-alone.  Added a simple regression test
	program to check that the types really are the same size across our
	platforms: new files testBaBarODMGTypes.{cc,t}.  Modified the
	GNUmakefile accordingly, and to eliminate the defunct dependency
	rule for consistencyTest.

97.12.22 gpdf
	History file begun.
