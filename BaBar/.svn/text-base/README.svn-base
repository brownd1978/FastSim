The BaBar package is meant to hold collaboration-wide 
include files, documents, etc.

Created Feb 24, 1995 by Bob Jacobsen at the request of David Quarrie.

BaBar.hh is a C++ include file to hold standard definitions, compiler
workarounds, etc.  The first use was to correct the absence of
"bool" in early compilers.  Its should not be used for holding
miscellaneous constants which are better placed in the packages which
need them.


Constants.hh declares the Constants class, which carries numerical
values for pi, etc.

	    see common reco HNitem 78 for discussion

97.12.22 gpdf - Added BaBarODMGTypes.h for use in defining platform-invariant
	fundamental types that are also consistent with Objectivity.

	Package BaBar will now become a DataFlow/offline "dual-use" package
	and will need especially careful control from now on, accordingly.

98.01.31 BobJ completed removing the *Consistency classes from here; they
        are now only in ProbTools
