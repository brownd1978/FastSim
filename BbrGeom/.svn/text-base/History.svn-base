cint dictionary

Added LIBEXTRARDLFILES line to GNUmakefile to define what goes into the
cint dictionary

Remove historic ifdef from Trajectory.hh, Make BbrErrProjector d'tor public
so that cint doesn't choke on it.

Change testBbrGeom.cc to use static BbrErrProject::localError.  I should
have done this when I made the change below.  Sorry.

Change BbrErrProjector::localError to STATIC, and hide ctor.  This forces
calling function directly without wasting time creating a temporary object
just to call functions.  This is conventional C++ hack to make a "class" act
as a "namespace" instead of an object.


Revision 1.3  1999/01/08 01:16:58  sschaff
Add TrkGeomTrajVisitor and TrkPieceTraj.


Revision 1.2  1999/01/07 22:23:24  sschaff
Fix botched History file.


Revision 1.1  1999/01/07 22:15:47  sschaff
Added Trajectory, TrkGeomTraj classes, History.  Updated link file, and 
fixed includes in BbrLorentzVectorErr.cc, BbrDoubleErr.cc, BbrError.cc, 
and BbrPointErr.cc, all of which were missing the package.
