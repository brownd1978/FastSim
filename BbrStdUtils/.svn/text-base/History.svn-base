13 Jan 10	Roberto Stroili
	split code in src and include directories

 8 May 04	Stephen J. Gowdy V00-01-31
	Remove some ; at the end of namespace declarations to
	remove warnings.

 7 Apr 03 	A. De Silva  V00-01-30
	Bug Fix:  Check boost's return values in babar::String::RegExp methods.
		  Also removed substr and pass string args to boost::RegEx 
		  using c_str().

17 May 02	A. De Silva
	1.  In BbrStdDeleteObject.hh, erase all except
	       #include "BbrStdUtils/BbrCollectionUtils.hh"
	       typedef babar::Collection::DeleteObject BbrStdDeleteObject;
 	2.  In CollectionUtils.hh, erase all except
	       #include "BbrStdUtils/BbrCollectionUtils.hh"
	       typedef babar::Collection::DeleteObject DeleteObject;
	       typedef babar::Collection::PtrLess BbrPtrLess;
	3.  In Collection.hh, erase all except
	       #include "BbrStdUtils/BbrCollectionUtils.hh"

 4 Apr 02	Gregory Dubois-Felsmann    V00-01-20
	Corrected declaration of findIndex() to be in terms of
	difference_type.  Possible now that the CLHEP "typename" bug has
	been fixed (CLHEP V01-06-01).
	[History BbrCollectionUtils.hh]

 3 Apr 02	A. De Silva
	Moved code to BbrCollectionUtils from other files.

25 Mar 02	M. Kelsey
	Add BbrStdMapDDL.hh to deal with hash-table migrations.

12 Mar 02	A. De Silva
	Renamed in-place functions toUpper and toLower to transformToUpper and 
	transformToLower.

11 Mar 02	A. De Silva
	Moved testString, testTokenize and testRegEx applications to this
	 package.

11 Mar 02 	David Norvil Brown
	Minor fixes to replace_RWContainers.pl.  Mostly cosmetic fixes.
	The most important fix alleviates problem of multiple 
	#include<vector> declarations if more than one RW Vector class
	is used (etc.).

28 Feb 02	David Norvil Brown
	Added script replace_RWContainers for RW migration of Container 
	classes.  DOES NOT migrate methods.  DOES correctly account for 
	pointers in templated pointer classes.

25 Feb 02	A. De Silva
	RegExp has boost dependencies but lives in babar::String namespace.

24 Feb 02	David Norvil Brown
	Added script replace_RWCString.pl for RW migration of RWCString class.

12 Feb 02 	A. De Silva
	Added Tokenize class. 

 1 Feb 02 	A. De Silva
	Removed operator>> and operator<< from String.*.

16 Jan 02	A. De Silva
	String.* added.  These contain functions, which live in a namespace, 
	that will ease the transition from RWCString to STL string.
