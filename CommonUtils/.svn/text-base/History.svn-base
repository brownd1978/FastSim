History, latest first:
----------------------

2010.01.14 Roberto Stroili
	o split code in src and include directories

2006.03.25 Rainer Bartoldus V00-12-00
        o Add missing <stddef.h> includes to several ComPackBase.hh
          derived class headers, which got exposed of using size_t
          without it by the fix in tag V00-11-00.

2006.03.21 Rainer Bartoldus V00-11-00
        o Make disallowed copy and assignment private and undefined
          rather than abort().  Remove then unused <stddef.h> header.
        o Remove BaBar.hh from all header files.  Except, leave
          BbrReferencer.hh alone as it is #include'd in 100+ packages
          through BtaCandidate (which itself has an extra BaBar.hh).
          Defer this to a later tag
        o Fix $Id tags in changed files.
        Note: Regression tests (still) fail on testBbrBitVector and
        timer. The latter apparently due to some debug printout.
        Note: The ComPack stuff should be moved to its own package.

2005.06.05 Andy Salnikov V00-10-00
	- Add default parameter to ComPathNameSearch, if it is true (default)
	  then the error message will be printed when file is not found, if
	  false then message will be suppressed. ComPathNameSearch returns
	  empty string in any case when it can't find the file
	- replace cerr with ErrMsg(error) in library class. Test applications
	  still use cerr. And there are _many_ cout's out ther, don't wanna 
	  touch that, I don't understand what all this stuff doing.
	- inserted typename in the template code where necessary.
	- replaced <strstream> stuff with <sstream> stuff. This should be 
	  eliminated completely, it is used only to convert command-line 
	  parameters into numbers and does it incorrectly. Can replace with
	  better and more efficient something, like SysUtils stuff

2004.08.24 Rainer Bartoldus V00-09-03
	Switch to standard use of std::distance.
	Replace an endl with a '\n' and add missing #include <iostream>.
	Remove "rscid" static.
	Lift #include "BaBar/BaBar.hh" to the top.

2004.08.18 Asoka De Silva V00-09-01
	Allow for special chars ":/" in extended collection syntax value.
	(Needed for Event ID filters.)

2004.08.16 Asoka De Silva V00-09-00
	Minor Framework migration - use AppFwkExitCode instead of FwkExitCode.

2004.07.24 Rainer Bartoldus V00-07-03
        Add searchFile to the nightly binlist category.
        [History binlist]
	
2004.06.03 ads tagged as V00-07-02
        Changes for the extended syntax collection - allow for string arguments
        and storing unsigned ints.       

2004.06.01 chcheng tagged chcheng-20040601a
        Put the order of member data in .hh file back to the original order, and
        reorder the initialization in the constructors to match the member data.

2004.06.01 chcheng tagged chcheng-20040601
	Fix warning messages.

2004.05.17 gpdf	V00-06-04
	Added knowledge of Framework's "stop requested" exit code (64) to
	terminationDecoder.  This adds a bin-phase dependency on Framework.
	Added some retroactive info for recent changes below.
	[History bin_CommonUtils.mk terminationDecoder.cc]

[2004.05.? ? V00-06-03
	Special tag that backs up ComPackedCovariance.cc to RCS revision
	1.3, on some backward-compatibility-with-existing-release grounds.]

2004.05.05 Rainer Bartoldus [V00-06-02]
	Introduce binlist file.

2004.05.04 A. De Silva Tagged V00-06-01
	Added print method to ComExtendedSyntaxParser.

[2004.04.27 ads V00-06-00 more changes to extended syntax parsing:
	"Extended syntax parser allows for different delimitors."]

2004.04.21 A. De Silva Tagged V00-05-00
	Changes to syntax parsing.  

2004.04.17 W. Hulsbergen
	Fixed bug in ComPackedCovariance.cc (dimension of vector with
	rotation angles). Tagged V00-04-20
2004.04.14 A. De Silva
	Added code for extended syntax parsing.  This will be used for 
	the extended collection syntax.

2004.02.27 A. De Silva
	Fixed errors on Sun that suddenly cripped up in the nightly:
	Error: Overloading ambiguity between "std::log(double)" and 
	"std::log(long double)" etc.
2003.07.28 Rainer Bartoldus (bartoldu)
	Add #include of BaBar.hh and ComPrintOnDelete.hh
	to ComPrintOnDelete.cc.

2002.04.10 A. De Silva
	Added operator<() method for Bbrreferencer.hh for use in std::map.

2002.03.24 A. De Silva
	RW migration.

2001.08.28 Dave Brown
	Add packer for rational numbers.
	Put a base class under ComPackBase, so that the return codes won't get
        templated (this is still backwards-compatible with templated 
        return codes).  Update ComPackRat to use these

2001.04.05 Asoka De Silva (Ads)
      * Fixed ComPackNonFlatFloat class as per David Aston's instructions to 
	avoid packing/unpacking errors.

2001.01.25 Stephen J. Gowdy (gowdy):
      * Add ComPackStrings which add a bunch of strings together to make
	one longer string.

2001.01.11 Stephen J. Gowdy (gowdy):
	Update test to test more functionality.

2001.01.10 Stephen J. Gowdy (gowdy):
 	Add simple class to back a number of bools into one byte.

2001.01.04 Dave Aston (dyaeb): temporary tag: dya20010104
      * Change ComPackedConsistencyBroken to set values of likelihood or 
        consistency which unpack as >1.0 at exactly 1.0, rather than as 
        the centre of the last bin <1.0. 
        This is an improvement only in reading the old MicroDST.  

2000.12.21 Dave Aston (dyaeb): temporary tag: dya20001221
      * Change ComPackedConsistency to store a hard zero only when given 
        a hard zero. All else less than the minimum representable number 
        unpacks at that minimum (about 3e-21 at the precision used). 

2000.12.13 Dave Aston (dyaeb): temporary tag: dya20001213
      * New classes cloned (otherwise unchanged) from the V00-03-02 
        tag of CommonUtils, viz: ComPackUFloatBroken, ComPackFloatBroken, 
        ComPackNonFlatFloatBroken, ComPackedConsistencyBroken and 
        ComPackedDEDXBroken.  
        This is a consistent "Broken" set to read the old MicroDST 
        after the BtdDataP and BtdDataR classes have been modified.  
      * ComPackFloat bugs fixed. Now behaves the same as ComPackUFloat 
        with an additional sign bit. 
      * ComPackFloat and  ComPackUFloat::testMe procedures improved.
      * ComPackFloat and  ComPackUFloat .t files updated.

2000.12.01 Dave Aston (dyaeb): temporary tag: dya20001201
      * Change ComPackedConsistency to give more precision -- 
        6 bits exponent & 6 bits mantissa in both likelihood and 
        consistency values. Packing is still as two d_UShorts but 
        now very differently arranged. It still uses ComPackUFloat.
      * Fix nasty bugs and features in ComPackUFloat! Best precision
        extends down to zero. Packing intervals are correctly centred 
        wherever possible (minor exceptions are: at minimum value != 0.;  
        at boundary of an exponent change). Only a hard zero (==0.) 
        packs and unpacks as a hard zero.
      * The same nasty bugs and features are still in ComPackFloat 
        (but they shouldn't be). 
      * Improved testCommonUtils test suite.

2000.11.22 Dave Brown
	Remove unnecessary and arbitrary range restriction in ComPackFlatFloat.
        
2000.11.02 Dave Brown
	Move packflat to packflatbroken and packflat_001 to packflat

2000.11.02 Phil Strother
	Remove old commented out includes.

2000.11.01 Lief Wilden
	Small change to the handling of overflows (as suggested by 
	David N. Brown):
	In case of an overflow (unpacked value > range of packer) unpacking 
	will be done to the center of last bin within the range of the packer.
	This means loosing one bin precision, but packing and unpacking will 
	be symmetric.

2000.10.29 Lief Wilden
	Small modifications to some packer classes. Unpacking is now
	done to "bin centers" and not the upper edge of a bin. This
	eliminates a systematic bias of the unpacked distributions.
	The following classes have been modified:
	ComPackFlatFloat / ComPackFloat / ComPackUFloat

2000.10.19 Dave Brown
        Add version of flat float packer which fixes packing problem.
        Apparently ComPackFlatFloat has a bug and in order to maintain 
        backward compatibility - ie, to preserve reproducibility with old data,
        a new class was added: ComPackFlatFloat_001.

2000.10.16 Dave Brown
	Fix some simple coding errors.  Standardize the meaning of the 
	_bitRange data member to a more sensible one, and provide a public 
	accessor

2000.10.13 Dave Brown
	Add exponential float packer.  This differs from the existing 
	packFloat in that the range and exponent values can be specified.

2000.10.05 Lief Wilden
	Moved several Bta* classes from BtaDataP.  These are renamed to Com*.

2000.07.12 sjg
	Remove definition of a RW operator== in ComMatrix.hh.

2000.03.22 ads
	Added a new function ComTimeStamp which returns the time stamp.

2000.02.19 ads
	Modified ComPathNameSearch so that (1) the environment BFRECOPATH is
	replaced by BFSEARCHPATH and (2) BFSEARCHPATH is used if it is defined;
	otherwise, the DEFAULTBFSEARCHPATH (previously known as 
	DEFAULTBFRECOPATH)  is used.

2000.02.18 gpdf	
	Added debugging tools 'terminator' and 'terminationDecoder'.
	[History GNUmakefile; new: terminator.cc terminationDecoder.cc]

2000.02.16 gpdf	
	Modified return codes from searchFile executable.
	Added History file.
	[searchFile.cc; new: History]
