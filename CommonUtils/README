			Class BbrCounter
			================

Keeps track of how many objects of a class X exist.  To use, publically
inherit X from BbrCounter<X>, then name sure you define 
  int BbrCounter<X>::_nAlloc;
somewhere

			Class BbrReferencer and BbrRefCounted
			=====================================

Mixin implementation of reference counting

			Class BbrRefCountedPointer
			==========================

Non-intrusive (doubly-indirected) reference counted pointer.

			Class ComPrintOnDelete<T>
			=========================

Class ComPrintOnDelete<T> is a template wrapper classes of type T
which have the function.

	print(ostream &) const;

Note that the function may have a return value of any type (which is
ignored), but must be a const function. The ComPrintOnDelete<T> owns a
pointer of type T*, whose print(ostream &) function is called when the 
ComPrintOnDelete<T> is deleted (or goes out of scope). This enables the
user to get, for example, a printed timing summary at the end of the job
from many timers, without having to go to each of these timers and tell
it to print its summary. See detailed documentation in ComPrintOnDelete.hh.
