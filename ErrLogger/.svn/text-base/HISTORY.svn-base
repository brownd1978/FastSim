        Change two optref to optref_ in ErrOptParser::OptHelper<T>::
        processValue(), addressing a compilation error under gcc345.
        It is rather mystifying how the other compilers should have
        missed that; it looks like a plain typo.  Perhaps it is/was
        never instatiated?  Also remove an unused implementation of
        strnlen, which caused a warning from gcc345.

	Introduction of implementation of "severe"==>exit(!=0).  Refactoring
	of many things in ErrLogger design, requiring changes to all 
	implementation classes.  Main change is moving all customizations
	out of the ErrStream class.  Wholesale re-evaluation of private/
	protected/public classifications of members.  Virtually every file 
	changed.

	Introduce a function ErrLog::severityName that allows an error 
	severity level to be converted to a string.  Added additional
	Doxygen comments to ErrLog.hh.
	[HISTORY ErrLog.{hh,cc}]

2004.07.22 gpdf	V01-02-00
	Introduce "severe" level so that users can start writing code that
	generates messages with that severity.  Currently it is set to be 
	numerically the same as "fatal", however, while the new implementation
	is developed.
	[HISTORY ErrLog.hh]

2004.01.31 gpdf	V01-01-00
	Inline the core logging() and checkLogging() methods of ErrLog.

        Remove extraneous token-pasting operators (##) from the
        ErrMsg and ErrLogging macros to prepare for compilation
        (or preprocessing) under gcc-3.

2002.06.16 gpdf	V01-00-00
	Primary overload of "code" argument to ErrLog::msg(), logging()
	changed; now is: "int".  "const char*" is now supported only for
	backward compatibility.  This allows the code to be used with
	CMLOG as originally intended.  Induces a mandatory migration for
	the OstErrLogger, FrameLogger, and OstFrameLogger packages.
	Also: various tidyings to the new ErrOpt* classes, notably 
	converting the new #includes to forward references in ErrLog.hh,
	to avoid exposing them to users.
	[modified almost every file -- use CVS for details]

	Fix bug that caused a warning not to be printed in the

August 19, 1999
	The work on Aug 9 has elicited bugs in _other_ peoples code,
	namely missing BaBar.hh.  Riccardo Faccini has added BaBar.hh
	to ErrLogger.hh.  This is definitely wrong.  However, I have
	tagged it as V00-05-03 and will release it or else we will ruin
	8.5.2.  This will be cleaned later.

August 9, 1999
	Removed CLHEP HepString class dependency.  It is suspected
	that HepString is not multi-thread safe and is causing some
	programs (LogManager) to crash when many messages are spewed
	at about the same time.

	Also, added an option to not report warnings as in multi-threaded
	program it reports erroneous messages.  The default behaviour
	is to report warnings like before.  Multi-threaded programs
	should turn it off.

	ErrLog now returns an ostream& rather than
	an ErrStream&.  ErrStream is still used
	underneath to trap messages.  This change
	should alleviate many of the problems that
	have been seen: conversion ambiguities and
	converting back to streams using ErrStream::Stream
	in particular.  ErrStream::Stream will be 
	removed from the interface after release 7.4.X.
	The ErrStream interface has been greatly
	simplified.

	If endl is called, endmsg will be called.

Sept. 29, 1998
	Change termination of error message
	to be marked by endmsg rather than
	endl.  Presently the change is
	nearly transparent, which means that
	it is transparent unless a user was
	incorrectly using the interface
	previously by not using endl to
	terminate the error message.
	Add basic.t.future.  This will be
	used in the future when endl is no
	longer used to terminate messages.	
	-Scott Metzler

August 18, 1998
	Augment documentation about using
	ErrStream::Stream when a conversion
	operator to ostream is encountered.
	-Scott Metzler

August 7, 1998 
	Fix ErrLog::msg to refer to the previous
	error message when reporting that the
	user did not insert ErrStream::Stream.
	It had been reporting that the present
	message was in error, rather than the
	previous.  Also, split README into
	README and HISTORY and update basic.t
	for changes made to the testing.  The
	new test verifies that the 'previous'
	message is flagged for error for not
	calling ErrStream::Stream.
	-Scott Metzler

May 8, 1998
	Add warning message if ErrStream::Stream
	is not called after a user defined
	operator<<, which forces a conversion
	from ErrStream to ostream.  Add
	link_ErrLogger because this package now
	uses HepString's.  Update basic.t.
