      If these functions may be called during the execution of
      a production executable, such as a framework job, they
      should be called using the error logger.  One elegant
      solution to this problem that does not tie your class to
      the error logger for only this print method is to define
      operator<< as a friend to this class.  Then the syntax
      for printing your object using the error logger would
      be:<BR>
      <BR>
      <em>
      yourClass theObj;<BR>
      ErrMsg(severity) << theObj << endmsg;<BR>
      </em>
      <BR>
      Your class could be printed using the error logger without
      operator<<, but this is by far the simplest, most natural,
      and most elegant way of doing this.

    <P>
    For stand-alone jobs, the minimum severity of messages can be set at the construction
    time of ErrStdLog.  ErrStdLog needs only to be instantiated somewhere before the first
    ErrMsg command is encountered.  Presumably, this would happen at the very beginning of
    the program.</P>

    <P>
    For framework applications, the minimum severity to be printed can be determined on the
    module level.  The module parameters verbose and production determine the minimum
    severity.  The minimum severity for the possible configurations is shown below.
