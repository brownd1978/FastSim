README for ErrLogger
--------------------

ErrLogger provides an abstract interface (ErrLog, and the ErrMsg macro
that provides a terse interface to the main use case) to a variety of 
underlying logging facilities. It's meant to be _really_ lightweight, 
in case we put it on top of some other implementation.

Some known implementations are in the FrameLogger, OstErrLogger, and
QtrErrLog packages.

Bob Jacobsen is package coordinator, gpdf admits to knowing something about it.
