	Change original decision that this package should not generate a
	library.  Now provides a dummy library to maintain the general
	structural standard that every package must provide a library.  It
	will be an acceptable optimization to arrange that this library
	does not appear in any link.  Added a History file and dollar-Id
	lines where missing.
	(Is this all too silly?  The proverbial hobgoblin of foolish 
	consistency?)
