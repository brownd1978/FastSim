README for Experiment package

BaBar and CDF are sharing code, but have different environments, compilers,
etc.  In BaBar, we originally were using the BaBar/BaBar.hh header to cope
with this.  Code shared with CDF is having this changed to Experiment.hh,
which at BaBar is equivalent.

This package is not meant to generate a useful library.
