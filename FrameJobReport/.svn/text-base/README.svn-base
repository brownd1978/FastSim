This package consists of the classes needed for generating the job summary
reports.  The files/classes are:

FjrFwkJobReport:
        Instantiates the Job Report for Framework.  It is a singleton since
        there is only one such object for Framework and a wrapper for the
	underlying JobReport classes.

FjrAbsJobReport:
	Abstract class.

FjrJobReportFile:
	Class to write to the job summary file.  
	It inherits from AbsJobReport.


Usage:
(Please also see the FrameExtension package on how to activate the job 
summary report).
	
#include "FrameJobReport/FjrFwkJobReport.hh"
...	
	FjrFwkJobReport* theReport = FjrFwkJobReport::getFwkJobReport();
	if (theReport->isEnabled()) {
	  theReport->report(FjrAbsJobReport::Bbr, hierarchy,
                      valueMeaning, value);
	}

In the above, 

- the first argument is the owner - can be either 
	FjrAbsJobReport::Bbr
  or 
	FjrAbsJobReport::Usr
- hierarchy is a string of the form
	level1::level2::...::levelN
  where the levelX are words comprising of characters [0-9a-zA-Z]
  and the upper level hierarchy level1::...::level(N-1) must be reported
  prior to level1::...::levelN (assuming N>1).
- valueMeaning is a string comprising of characters [0-9a-zA-Z]
- value is a string which does not have a '\n'.

The output in the summary file will be of the form:
Bbr::hierarchy.valueMeaning value
  or
Usr::hierarchy.valueMeaning value
