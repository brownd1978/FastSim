	split code in src and include directries

Feb   4, 2008   Rainer Bartoldus V02-03-03
        Set myInstance to 0 in the AppErrLogModule destructor to keep
        getLogHistogram() from returning an invalid pointer after the
        module has been destroyed. (Found to generate invalid reads
        during ErrMsg output in the DhpTupleEnv destructor, as well as
        a crash in Moose.)

Aug  29, 2007   Chih-hsiang Cheng (by Rainer Bartoldus) V02-03-02
        Update link files.

        Fix bugs initializing histogram ptr

Mar  21, 2007   Jim Hamilton V02-03-00
    	Added framework module to book histogram of ErrMsg severities.

Nov. 16, 2004.  Asoka De Silva V02-02-02
	Using ostringstream instead of sprintf to convert to strings in
	job reporting.

Aug. 25, 2004.  Gregory Dubois-Felsmann  V02-02-01

	[link_FrameLogger.mk History]

Aug. 02, 2004.  Gregory Dubois-Felsmann  gpdf-20040802a
	Migrated to ErrLogger V02-00-00.
	[AppErrLog.{hh,cc} History]

Jul. 23, 2004.  Asoka De Silva  V01-02-00
	Modified for new error level in ErrLog.hh.

Feb. 04, 2004 	Asoka De Silva	V01-00-01
	History file added (split from README).
	Added job reporting to dump the number of messages by severity.
	If a message is fatal, the statistics are dumped to the job report
	file before the fatal crash.

June 17, 2002   Gregory Dubois-Felsmann   V01-00-00
	Adapt to ErrLogger V01-00-00.  Remove spurious dependencies, including
	Rogue Wave.
	[README AppErrLog.{hh,cc} AppActionErrLogger.{hh,cc}
	 link_FrameLogger.mk; remove: dummy.cc]

Jul. 18, 2001   Rainer Bartoldus
        Add beforeOther()/afterOther() methods to AppActionErrLogger.
        Reorder declarations/definitions for readability.
        Reset current executable/module on afterEndRun() also (was missing).

May. 12, 2000	Asoka De Silva
	Framework migration.  AppAction method name change.

Mar. 23, 2000	Asoka De Silva 
	Prepend timestamp to messages if production is set in Framework.
 
Aug. 25, 1999	Scott Metzler	V00-02-01
	Accept modules, input modules, output modules
	and filter modules as exec types to check for
	verbose.

Mar. 04, 1999	Scott Metzler	V00-02-00
	Include all executable types for generating
	facility name.  This is accomplished by
	adding a pointer to the current executable.

Feb. 07, 1999   Scott Metzler	V00-01-07
	Extend AppActionErrLogger and AppErrLog
	so that they can be more easily used
	by OstErrLogger.

Oct. 16, 1998	Scott Metzler	V00-01-04
	Print error message into ostream instead of
	ErrStream.  ErrStream is still underlying

	Change to return ErrStream instead of ostream.

March 28, 1998	Bob Jacobsen	V00-00-00
