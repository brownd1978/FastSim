Entries (latest first):

Jan 14 2010	R. Stroili
	split code in src and include directories

Oct 04 2006	A. De Silva
	Removed FwkString.

Nov 06 2004     A. De Silva
	Reworked APPListDeleteAll() to erase objects faster.

Sep 26 2003 	A. De Silva
	Removed PYTHON.  Tagged as V00-04-07.

Mar 19 2003     R. Bartoldus
        Add missing typename keywords to APPList.cc to allow compilation
        under gcc-3.

Mar 18 2003     R. Bartoldus
        Add a missing typename keyword to APPListIterator to allow it
        to compile under gcc-3.
        [History APPListIterator.hh ]

Mar 28 2002	A. De Silva
	FwkString is back. (tagged V00-04-02)

Mar 14 2002	A. De Silva
	APPList uses STL instead of RWCString.

2001.11.28	V00-02-17	Gregory Dubois-Felsmann
	System header file usage corrected.  Applicable to all releases, not
	just the Unix98-ish 11-series.
	[History ftclCmdSelect.h]

Apr 16 2001	G. Raven
	AbsInterp.cc modified - don't call getenv() unless it is to be used.

Feb 28 2001 	A. De Silva
	APPList::insert( const Item *theItem, const Item *beforeItem ) now 
	inserts to list if beforeItem=0.  Ditto for args passed by ref.


Feb  7 2001     A. De Silva
	New class AbsCommand to break circular dependency between FrameUtil
	and Framework.  Also ifdef-ed out Python code since that interpreter is
	not used by BaBar - it pulls in Framework dependency so it should be 
	fixed first before use, if ever.

Jan  4 2001	A. De Silva
	Go back to original design -  exitTcl is no longer faked in
	FtclInterp::startInterpLoop() when an EOF is encountered; "exit" is
	instead.

Dec  8 2000	A. De Silva
	Introduced two new methods in AbsInterp: 
	void setDoLoopInterp(bool) 	and 
	bool getDoLoopInterp() const
	These are needed to tell the Interpreter loop as to when it should
	exit (such as when a sourced tcl script has a Framework exit command.)
	Also fixed a bug which caused exit/quit commands, buffered by blank 
	characters, to be ignored.

Nov 20 2000	A. De Silva
	Prior to this change, when an EOF was encountered, an exit was faked
	in FtclInterp::startInterpLoop().  This has been changed so that 
	exitTcl is now faked.

Nov 10 2000	A. De Silva
	runCommandFile returns AbsInterp::OK or AbsInterp::ERROR.

Jun 30 2000	A. De Silva
	exitTcl defined in FtclInterp.cc ctor.  (this redefines the tcl exit
	command which otherwise would be clobbered by Framework.)

Jun 05 2000	A. De Silva
	Fixed memory leaks.
 	Also, APPListDeleteAll() deletes items in reverse order.
 	New method appendResult() in AbsInterp class.  
 	Also reimplemented AbsInterp::setResult() as per TCL manual guidelines 
   	(ie, don't write directly to tcl_interpreter->result !)

May 24 2000	A. De Silva
	This version has a bug fix in APPList::append(item* theItem, item*
	afterItem).

May 21 2000	A. De Silva
	Moved inline code from APPList*.icc to *.hh and to *.cc (non-inline.)
	Moved in test program for APPList from AListAdapter package.
	Removed string.hh class since this conflicts with STL.

May 12 2000	A. De Silva
	Conversion to use FwkString in all FrameUtil code.

May 08 2000	A. De Silva
	Check Tcl return status before printing error message in 
	runCommandFile method.

May 07 2000	A. De Silva
	Removed printout of tcl->result when command files are evaluated.  
	This removes extra lines, which have ni information, from printing. 
 	(Error messages in tcl were already being generated.)

May 06 2000	A. De Silva
	Reintroduce AbsInterp::theInterpreter(Tcl_Interp*) method in 
	AbsInterp.  This is needed by other packages (RooModules, GraDisplay 
	and  OepFramework) which I don't want to force migrations on now.  
	(Also needed if TK code is not yanked out in Framework.)

May 04 2000	A. De Silva
	New implementation of APPList class.

May 03 2000	A. De Silva
	Another method added to APPList.  This was in HepAList and other 
	packages need it.

May 02 2000	A. De Silva
	FwkString has a isEmpty() method.  This is to ease the Framework 
	migration since it was present in HepString and packages used it.
	length() and operator[] implemented in APPList.  These were present in
	HepAList and BaBar needs them.

May 01 2000	A. De Silva
	Interp stuff are code changes from CDF.  FwkString is a new class 
	meant to replace HepAString in Framework code.
	APPList containers moved here from Framework.

(History file prior to this was missing.)
