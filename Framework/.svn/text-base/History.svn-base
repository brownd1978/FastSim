History (latest first)

Jan 14, 2010 Roberto Stroili
	split code in src and include directories

Oct 04, 2006 Asoka De Silva
	Removed FwkString.

Jul 13, 2006 Asoka De Silva	
	Made AbsParmGeneral<bool> behave consistent with AbsParmBool in 
	accepting 1 and 0 as true/false.

Nov 14, 2005 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed dumb bug in AppModuleCommand (compare strings) for 
	"module enable path <name>" command.

Jul 01, 2005 Stephen J. Gowdy
	Remove ambiguity in AbsParmFilename.

Mar 14, 2005 Asoka De Silva
	Made AppInputModule an abstract class and created two new classes,
	AppFileInput and AppCollectionInput which inherit from it.  Also
	created corresponding command classes AppFileInputCommand and
	AppCollectionInputCommand.

Jan 17, 2005 Michael Kelsey
	AppMain.cc:  Change "exit(status)" to "::exit(status)" to prevent
	some other library from intercepting exit code and multiplying by
	256 :-(

Jan 03, 2005 Asoka De Silva
	Removed an assert from AppFramework (call ::abort() instead).  

Nov 09, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Removed all changes bewtween V01-08-01 and V01-09-00.  Also 
	renamed function in use only in AppFramework and put it inside
	an anonymous namespace.
	Removed AbsParm::_parmList.  
	Removal of objects from APPList made to work faster.
	Added AppExecutable:;fullReport(const std::string&) method.

Oct 05, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed AbsParm's _parmList type as APPList instead of std::set.
	so that we have the same order of printout for PrintParms on
	any platform.	

Oct 05, 2004 Rainer Bartoldus
	Migrate from strstream to stringstream.  Change return type of
	AppStopType::getStopTypeKey() from char* to string to allow
	this migration.  (Also addresses a memory leak in
	FrameExamples.)  Update link file to remove BaBar.

Aug 31, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Made adding actions more like adding modules.  That is, 
	actions should be added as 
	  theFramework->add(...)
	instead of 
	  theFramework->actions()->append(...)
	This also provides a framework pointer in actions.
	Also included a script to do package migrations (FwkMigrate_Action).
	The older method of adding actions will remain intact until such time
	as when this migration is completed.

Aug 26, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Removed all "BaBar/BaBar.hh" in favor of "Experiment/Experiment.hh"
	Fixed AppFramework::show() to show all actions when "show" is
	typed at prompt.
	Fixed the many compilation warnings on Linux.

Aug 23, 2004 Rainer Bartoldus
	Reconstruct the link_Framework.mk file, which got lost in a
	previous tag.  Remove many (all) #include "BaBar/BaBar.hh" and
	"Experiment/Experiment.hh" from header files, where they don't
	belong, as well as a few "BaBar/Experiment.hh".  Add $Id$ tags
	to many source files that had them missing (and a few that had
	them broken).

Aug 16, 2004 Rainer Bartoldus
	Move all sources from the src to the top directory.
	Modify the top GNUmakefile accordingly.
	Move all headers from the Framework subdirectory to the top
	directory.
	Lift BaBar_FrameworkRc.tcl to the top and change
	AppFramework.cc accordingly.
	Remove six remaining APP* forwarding headers from the top.

Aug 16, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Included FwkMigrate_APP migration script and removed FwkMigrate_v3.
	Also did a minor migration of FwkExitCode to AppFwkExitCode.
	This will be tagged as V01-01-00.

Jul 30, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	New AppReportAttributes to allow for specifying how many levels
	of a hierarchy to list (in mod/path list) and to also suppress
	printing of previously listed sequence members.
	New command seq/path listMembers.
	Removed indentation code from APPFramework.  
	For more details/usage, please do seq help and path help.
	Also order of endjobs reversed.

Jun 07, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Source FrameScripts/BaBarScripts.tcl for all Framework jobs.

May 21, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Reverse order of modules in endJob().  This is meant to be temporary 
	for testing.  Tagged as ads21May04-2.  This is removed from the HEAD
	of Framework.

Apr  8, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Moved AbsParmBool strictModuleDisable to APPFramework.  It was 
	left in APPModule by mistake.

Apr  1, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	- removed _theAbsEvent and APPFramework::theEvent().
	- changed char* to const char* in APPCommand::command() return value.
	- eliminate duplication of APPCommand's name in AbsParm 
	  (removed _name).
	- APPExecutable::description() returns const char* instead of char*.
	- APPExecNode inlined.
	- flag for generating errors or warnings when disabling non-existing
	  modules.  strictModuleDisable (by default) will only print
	  warning messages.  if set to true, it will generate error messages 
	  and stop further processing of the tcl file.

Mar 31, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Removed Accounting modules.  Tagged as ads31Mar04. 

Mar 30, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Many bug fixes in APPModuleCommand, APPSequenceCommand and 
	APPPathCommand.  This is still link compatible, if necessary, to 
	V00-12-00.  tagged as ads30Mar04.

Feb 26, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Removed static _theAbsEvent from APPFramework and APPModule.
	Data member _theAbsEvent still exists in AppFramework temporarily
	since there are two packages which still use it.

Feb 24, 2004 Asoka De Silva
	Added deleteEvent() to AppInputModule.

Jan 30, 2004 Rainer Bartoldus
        Change AbsParmString to contain its FwkString data member by
        value rather than allocating it on the heap.  Add a set()
        method to AbsParmString	as it exists for other AbsParm types.

Dec  8, 2003 Asoka De Silva
	Added FwkExitCodes.hh for exit codes to be used in Framework 	
	applications.  Also added FrameJobReport's job summary file
	in APPMain.cc.

Aug 14, 2003 Asoka De Silva
	Removed ifdef CDF.  Tagged as V00-09-00.  
	Also, this History file created.

Jul 30, 2001 Asoka De Silva
	AbsParmIfdStrKey moved to AbsParm package.

Jul 18, 2001 Rainer Bartoldus
        Add beforeOther()/afterOther() methods to AppAction and
        AppActionController.  Reorder methods for readability.
        Implement the use of the actions in the corresponding other()
        methods in APPFramework and AppActionApplicator.  All of this
        in anlogy to beforeEvent()/afterEvent().

Jun 21, 2001 Rainer Bartoldus
        Make APPCommand and AbsParm* assignment operator arguments const.

Jun 11, 2001 Rainer Bartoldus
        Default assignment of e.g. AbsParmBool leads to memory corruption!
        Declare copy constructors and assigment operators for all AbsParm*
        and APPCommand. Other classes need to follow. Made private without
        implementation to disallow for now. Should add implementations later.

Fev 28, 2001 Asoka De Silva
	Fix to prevent dereferencing pointers to null in APPSequence.cc's 
	insert methods (REMEDY 4898).

Feb  7, 2001 Asoka De Silva
	APPCommand now inherits from FrameUtil/AbsCommand to break circular
	dependency.

Feb  5, 2001 Asoka De Silva	
	Removed a few ifdef CDF statements pertaining to AppFramework ctor
	(3rd arg is now removed from Opr software so we can do this now.)
	Also fixed bug so that if the default path (AllPath) has been deleted, 
	cloning a module does not cause Framework to try and add it to a 
	non-existing path.

Jan 10, 2001 Asoka De Silva
	If a proc redefines a tcl command, an error message will be generated 
	and the Framework application will terminate.

Jan.  4, 2001 Asoka De Silva
	Assert if a command is redefined.

Dec.  8, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed a bug where an exit command in a tcl script, when sourced, 
	did not cause a Framework application to exit.

Dec.  5, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed bug in APPSequenceCommand::insertHandler.  Now, if the sequence
	is empty and a module is inserted, jobs will not SEGV.

Nov. 27, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed a few memory leaks.

Nov. 14, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Generate more information in AppSourceFileCommand if there is
	an error.

Nov. 10, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Bug fix in APPModuleCommand where AbsInterp::Error was not being
	set.

Nov.  1, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Invalid commands will be printed out so that they can be tracked down.

Oct. 18, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Removed "module action" "action on" and "action off" commands.
	This is the last stage of the migration begun on Jun 11.  (see below.)

Jul. 06, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed bug in check for commands which were redefined.

Jul. 05, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	More things in migration script.  (Also has non-Framework stuff.)
	(Note that this script will be removed when migrations are completed.)
	
Jul. 04, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Hold off asserting if commands are redefined.  This will be reinserted
	at a later date.

Jun. 30, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Flushed out several memory leaks in memento code.  Changed dump*
	command so that existing file is not overwritten.  Removed exitTcl
	definition from rc file - it is now defined in FrameUtil code.
	Also, now if a command is redefined, an error message is generated 
	before an assert.

Jun. 11, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Simplified actions so that only "action enable/disable <action>" 
	commands are valid.  Older action commands are still valid but will 
	give warnings.  These will be removed at a later date.  Also fixed 
	memento code to dump/restore actions.

Jun.  8, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	AppFramework ctor has 3 args again for BaBar, but the third 
	(Tcl_Interp*) is ignored.  This is needed for OepFramework during the 
	migration for backward compatibility.  This change will be removed 
	circa Aug 00.

Jun.  7, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Removed obsolete tcl files.  Reformatted some code (to 80 chars).
	Moved endJob() from AppFramework::talkTo() to APPMain.cc; 
	this was otherwise fatal for BaBar's OEP and OPR packages.	

Jun.  3, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Code cleanup, fixed bug where module/path/sequence name was
	not printed out when it was unknown.  Also eliminated TK code
	(and lots of ifndef CDFs in the process.)

Jun.  1, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Cleanups and used partial/fullReport() instead of cout.

May. 26, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Cleaned up AppFramework destructor.  Made action dtor virtual.
	removed  setupTheApp(), setCommandPrompt().
	Fixed several memory leaks.
	
May. 17, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Renamed Fwk_macro_migrate to FwkMigrate_v1 since there are now
	more than just macro migrations in there.

May. 12, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Merged code with CDF's 1999 code.  Changes include:
	
 1.     Interpreter role of the Framework is moved out of the package to 
        FrameUtil.  (There is still the Babar TK code, which is pulling the 
        interpreter in, but I will rip this out later.)

 2.     HepString has been replaced with FrameUtil/FwkString (derived from 
        RWCString in BaBar.)  There are still a few places where these remain
        but they are ifdef'ed for BaBar (eg AbsParmIfdStrKey which should be
        moved to the AbsParm package one day.)                        

 3.     HepAList has been replaced with a new container class APPList and the 
        iterator APPListIterator.  (These will reside in the FrameUtil 
        package.) Note that the containers are now of a list of pointers.

 4.     inputEvent() removed from APPModule.  In APPInputModule, this now has 
        two args.  inputEvent() is also overloaded to avoid a migration in 
        BaBar.

 5.     help() and show() now have two args.

 6.     Memento code: CDF's changes were removed.  APPList and FwkString
        replaces HepAList (and iterator) and HepString where applicable. 

 7.     Many cleanups; among them:      
          ErrLogger calls removed.
          Spurious includes removed.
          ProxyDict calls ifdef'ed for BaBar. 


Mar. 24, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Added code to print time stamp (if framework verbose is set) before
	and after module etc. destructors are called during the framework
	shutdown. 
	
Mar. 17, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Moved sourceFoundFile command definition from APPFramework to AppModule.

Mar. 10, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	In AppModuleCommand, removed warning when attempting to disable
	modules which do not exist.  (All other warnings remain intact 
	when modules do not exist.)  

Mar.  3, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	In frameworkrc.tcl, renamed the original tcl "exit" command as
	"exitTcl" so that it is not clobbered by Framework.  Also made
	sequences work in code.

Feb. 10, 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Fixed bug in AppModuleCommand ("module action enable ..." did not 
	set the enable actions flag for disabled modules.)
	Modified code so that commands are checked to see if they are being 
	redefined.  (If so, a warning message is generated.)

Jan. 12 2000 Asoka De Silva
	Provide "sourceFoundFile" Tcl command.

Jan. 12 2000 Akbar Mokhtarani
	Implemented the command "module enable path <path1> <path2> ..."

Jan. 11 2000 Asoka De Silva
	AppFileName is implemented to use CommonUtils/ComPathNameSearch.

Dec. 14 1999 Alex Samuel
        Add set_value methods to AbsParmGeneral for signed and unsigned short.

Nov. 14 1999 Asoka De Silva
	Made APPCommand::description() virtual and return string.  This 
	corrected a bug -- help, within module talk, did not print
	out the AbsParm* descriptions. Also, user added descriptions are also
	printed out, in addition to the default AbsParm* class descriptions, 
	when help is invoked.   

Oct. 27 1999 Akbar Mokhtarani
	Added initForRestore function in APPCommand to take care of 
	problem with cloning lists.

Oct. 20 1999 Asoka De Silva
	Copy constructors for AbsParm* added (except for AbsParm itself 
	which is abstract.)

Oct. 19 1999  Alex Samuel
	Add accessor for Framework's stop-request flag.  Initialize
        the flag to false in the constructor.

Oct.  4 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Implemented "path/sequence enable/disable all".

Oct.  1 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Online help updated and implemented when missing.  Small memory leak
	fixed in APPFramework.cc.

Aug. 16 1999  Asoka De Silva
 	Moved code from AppFileName to AbsParmFilename so that if a file is
	not found in the search path, the decision about what to do next is 
	with AbsParmFilename.  Also extended AppFileName with new methods to
	check if a file exists.
 
Aug. 11 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Added BFROOT to the end of the default path in AppFilename.cc.

Aug.  9 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Fixed bug reported in Remedy 2623. 

Jul. 27 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Added class AppFileName to handle multiple paths.  Modified
	AbsParmFilename to use this class.
 
Jul. 21 1999  Asoka De Silva
	Fixed several bugs reported in Remedy (2510, 2141, 2158, 2253, 2146).

Jun. 24 1999  Michael Kelsey
	Change src/GNUmakefile to build APPMain.o explicitly, by compiling
	APPMain.cc.  Previous version extracted it from the .a library after
	the latter was built (this fails during shared-library build).

Apr. 19 1999  Gregory Dubois-Felsmann
	Change AppStop.{hh,cc} to use AppStream instead of APPStream.
	Avoids an "incomplete class" error in compilation.

Apr.  8 1999  David Quarrie
	Rework the handling of output streams. A stream is now an abstract
	concept, with a file stream being a concrete implementation of
	this, corresponding to an output file. This is supported by the
	AppOutputCommand class that implements a generic "output" command,
	with the AppFileOutputCommand subclass customizing this for the
	concrete case of output files. Finally, the AppStreamsOutputModule
	provides an abstraction for a multi-streamed output module, with the
	AppFileOutputModule providing a concrete implementation based on
	output files. These changes have obsoleted the APPStream, 
	APPOutputCommand and APPFileOutputModule classes, which have been 
	removed.

Apr.  7 1999  G. Dubois-Felsmann
	Add AbsParmGeneral<>::set_value(unsigned*), as for (int*).
	Fix long-standing size bug in set_value(int*).

Mar. 30 1999  M. Kelsey
	Add AbsParmGeneral<>::set_value(long*), idential to (int*).

Jan. 29 1999  A. De Silva
	Moved APPMODULE* macros from APPModule.hh to BaBar/BaBar.hh.

Nov. 25 1998  Akbar Mokhtarani
	moved XXXMemento file from FrameMemento to tjis package because
	of the dependecy of this package on FrameMemento it was thought
	to add these few calsses here instead of making a new package.

Nov. 22 1998  Akbar Mokhtarani
	Did the following changes to construct a history of modules and
	their AbsParmXXX settings:
	added setAbsArg, getVal functions to AbsParm and it subclasses.
	added a "value" function to APPModule to return the command
	value
	added node() function to APPSequence.hh to return the _nodes

Oct 27, 1998 Alex Romosan
	changed AbsParmFilename to find either a regular file or a
	directory.

June 29, 1998 M. Kelsey
	Add comments to AbsParmFilename.hh and .cc, explaining purpose
	and use of search path, and search names RELEASE and PARENT.

Jan-Apr '98 Marc Turcotte
       Added AppFrame and dynamic dispatch 

Dec 8, 1997  Phil S
	Add operator== to AbsParmIfdStrKey.

Nov  7, 1996  A. Mokhtarani - leak removal

Nov  6, 1996 B. Jacobsen - fix for Tcl symbol definition in AppMain,
              should always return 0 to shell at end of job
