Particle Data Table package.

  the scripts:
  
      PdtGeant.script
      PdtLund.script
      
  produce automatically the code for PdtGeant and PdtLund classes
  converting the particle ASCII names in the tables into names 
  compatible with C++.

Added Binary Search Tree classe Pdtb which uses the FSF derived classes
PdtEntrySet and PdtEntryBSTSet.  These later two classes are in files named
PdtbSet and PdtbBSTSet for brevity.   -- J. LoSecco, 20 November 1998

Renamed Pdtb to Pdt so that it is normally used.  Since the internal details
are hidden this should have no effect on consumers of this code. - J. LoSecco

Workaround in PdtbBSTSet.cc to avoid problem on OSF.  Added a dummy entry to
struct _fake_node in PdtEntryBSTSet::balance().  The new definition is
identical to that of PdtEntryBSTNode so optimization etc. does not destroy it.
Tested on Sun and OSF with and without optimization.  - J. LoSecco

Modify Pdt to cache entry for most popular particles types.

Fix bug in PdtEntry where it failed to initialize _pidNeutType for 2/3 of
it constructors.
