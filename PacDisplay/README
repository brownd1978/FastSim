PACDISPLAY  README

1)PacDisplay Module
Module stores neccesary display information in separate .root file
specified by user. Default name is display.root

talkto PacDisplay {
	fileName set display.root 	#file name to store data
	saveGen set true          	#set true to save generated track info
	saveSim set true		#set true to save simulated track info
	saveRec set true		#set true to save reconstructed track info
	saveDet set true		#set true to save detector info
	saveHit set true		#set true to save hit info
	resolution set 200		#resolution of track, divide track into N segments (100-300 is reasonable)
	eventBegin set 0		#event number to start saving
	eventEnd set 20			#event number to stop saving
}

2)PacDisplay.C (Macro works in ROOT)
Typical ROOT session should look as follows

root [0] .L PacDisplay.C++  
root [1].x PacDisplayStart("display.root","shd",50,1,true)

Options are follows
"display.root" = file name
"shd" = types of image to be diplayed
	(s) = simulated track
	(g) = generated track
	(r) = reconstructed track
	(h) = hits on detector
	(e) = emc cluster
	(d) = detector
50 = sets transparent range [0-100] set 0 for no transparency, 100 for 100% transparent, [40-60%] recommended for good effect 
1 = starting event
true = shows/hides end cap

!!Click on object to display object information!!

3) Some useful openGLViewer command
W = wireframe
R = rendered surface
T = rendered surface with wireframe
Arrow key = move object around
Arrow key + Ctrl = move object slowly
Arrow key + Shift = move objects fast 
J = zoom in
K = zoom out
Left Mouse Button  = Rotate view
Right Mouse Button = Zoom in/out
Center Mouse Button = Move object around
