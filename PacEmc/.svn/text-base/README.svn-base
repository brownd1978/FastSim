This package contains the classes used to describe the EM calorimeter used in
PACRAT.


o  PacEmcModel:

    Read the config file to set up Emc geometry, including the radius
    and the segmentation in theta and phi.

o  PacEmcDigi and PacEmcCluster

     - To take the role of EmcDigi and EmcCluster in Babar
         (simplified, without calibration, data-flow info, etc)

     - Often-used moment calculations are imported too, and can be
       accessed to through PacEmcCluster.

     - PacEmcDigi uses PacEmcModel to translate index to real coordinates.

o  PacEmcClusterEnergySums and PacEmcXClMoments

    - Calcuate shape variables.

o  PacReconstructEmc

   -  Contains a method returning a PacEmcCluster
    PacEmcCluster *PacReconstructEmc::makeEmcCluster(const PacSimTrack *simtrk)

      if simtrk intersects a detector element with 

          measurementType()==PacMeasurement::Calor

      a cluster is created

          pelem->measurement()->createEmcCluster(*ihit,cluster);
                 -------------
                  |-> a  PacMeasurement


o  PacEmcClusterMeas

     - subclass of PacMeasurement

     - has a method to create a cluster
  virtual void createEmcCluster(const PacSimHit& hit, PacEmcCluster *cluster) const;

          Currently there is a trivial implementation for photons: 
             Building a PacEmcCluster with one PacEmcDigi whose energy is
             exactly equal to incident momentum of PacSimHit.
