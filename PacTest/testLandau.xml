This document is a part of the sample experiment description in a format
which would eventually turn into EDML:
 
  "Experiment Description Markup (or Modelling) Language"
 
Right now we don't have any formal schema for EDML. Therefore
the current implementation of a EDML parser would check both
syntax and semantics of the model. Besides, introducing the formal
XML schema for EDML may  result in some changes in a syntax
of EDML.
