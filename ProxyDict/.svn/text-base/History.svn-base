		15Jan10 RS	split code in src and include directories
V02-02-01       24Sep04 perazzo Remove include BaBar.hh from hh files.
V02-02-00       05Aug04 RB      Change #define IFDKEY_BUFSIZE to enum in
                                IfdStrKey.hh to work around a bug in ROOT
                                4.00-08 Cint.
V02-01-00       04Aug04 RB      Automated iostreams migration.
V02-00-08	10May04 SJG	Remove a set of warnings in a test unit.
V02-00-07	10May04 SJG	Remove cmr's changes below.
V02-00-06	08May04 SJG	Remove warnings with +w/-Wall.
V02-00-05	11Feb04 perazzo  Add ifndef VXWORKS around std::string
				 to allow compilation with the old
				 (2.7.2) gcc cross compiler which is used
				 to build the segment level.

cmr-031123      23Nov03 cmr      Add IfdDataMakerProxy (and corresponding
                                 IfdHepAListMakerProxy) to support lazy
                                 evaluation of data from the dictionary.
                                 IfdMaker class added as base class for
                                 the lazy evaluaiton.
V02-00-04       18Aug03 GB       Put in insertion markers for the iostreams
				 migration into AbsArgTest.cc, IfdKeyTest.cc
				 and IfdSimpleProxyDictTest.cc. (This is a 
				 comment line which gives a hint to the 
				 migration script as to where to put the
				 using std::<keyword> declarations.)

V01-00-05	24Jul03 perazzo	 Based on V01-00-04, get IfdTypeKey.hh
				 from the head of CVS.

V02-00-03	10Jul03 EDF	 Rip out IFDTYPEKEY_SPECIALIZE entirely. 
				 Although, technically, this is an interface
	                         change, no one ever used this feature.  It
                                 is a relic from the development 7 years ago.
				 So I'm just bumping up the patch number, not
                                 the major version number

rb-030709       09Jul03 RB       Deprecate the use of IFDTYPEKEY_SPECIALIZE
                                 by disabling the corresponding macro
                                 definition.  This switch was introduced as a
                                 work-around for compilers that don't support
                                 static data in templated classes.  It is no
                                 longer needed by any of our current compilers,
                                 but the macro recently got in the way of the
                                 iostreams migration.  So I am trying to
                                 retire it now.

V02-00-02	12Nov02 EDF	 Make it compile on linux. 

V02-00-01       12Nov02 perazzo  Changes for Online build via control/ and
				 segment/ subdir makefiles.
V02-00-00	09Nov02 EDF	 Add ctor from std::string for IfdStrKey.
				 Since this is the first use of the standard
				 library in ProxyDict, bump the major release
				 number up to 2.

V01-00-02	26Feb02 EDF	 Remove IfdSimpleProxyDictSpeedTest.cc from
                                 build.  I'm having some link troubles and
                                 we don't need this at the moment.

V01-00-00	06Aug01 EDF	 Remove IfdData.  It's been defunct for a long
	                         time.  There are no inheritance requirements 
				 for something to be put into a proxy dict.

		02Aug01 ads	 Removed IfdhepAList.hh forwarding header.

	        09Jan01 ads      Ran Framework/FwkMigrate_v3 script 
			         (please see script for details of changes.)
			         Removed catch, if any, from tcl scripts.
			         Updated *.mk files with link-makefiles script.

V00-07-02	27Oct99 EDF	-Tag for Jaceks change to memset for fast init

V00-07-01	28Jul99 EDF	-Tag for ryd-990728
ryd-990728      28Jul99 ryd     -Fix memory leak in Ifd.cc for markForStore
                                 and itemStore members.
V00-07-00	02Jun99 EDF	-Enough screwing around with the pseudo off
				 by one error.  Abandon link compatability,
				 change shape of IfdSimpleProxyDictEntry and
				 IfdSimpleProxyDict and code the deletion
				 list correctly.  Checked leaks w/ workshop.
				 Reported errors all look OK (not real leaks).

V00-06-10	27May99 SJG	-Updated entry in this file for me
				-Added // $$ before hack in IfdSimplePD.cc
                27May99 JML     -Fixed an initialization bug (off by 1 count)
                                 in IfdSimpleProxyDict.cc
V00-06-09	18apr99 EDF	-Missed a case in the dtor for the _myData.
V00-06-08	18apr99 EDF	-Screwed up link compatibility w/ 8.0.1 becuase
				 of Rainers' fix.  Patched.
V00-06-07	18apr99 EDF	-Fix leak introduced in 06-06, found by gpdf

rb-990417       17Apr99 RB      -Make char* argument of Ifd<T>::put const.  

V00-06-06	17apr99 EDF	-Make simple proxydict delete in order
				 of insertion because of Trk code.  Impl.
				 is disgusting in order to be link compatible
				 w/ 8.0.1.  Will make cleaner/faster when
				 we build a release.

V00-06-05	08apr99 EDF	-Back out the clever DictKey stuff, below.

V00-06-04	07Apr99 EDF	-Some cleanup relative to work below.  changes
				 object shapes.  

V00-06-03	07Apr99 EDF	-Lots of optimization work.
				   a)  Keys now have better hash values.
				   b)  SimpleProxyDict now does hashing.
				   c)  DictKeys violoate Liskov by not
					owning their kids (the parent does
					own them.).  Will perhaps clean later.
					Gives big speedup.
				   d)  Added speed test.  May only work on sun

V00-06-02	17Mar99 EDF	-Yury's fix for delete in IfdAliasProxy.
				-Accessor for cardinality in composite key.

V00-06-01	01Feb99 EDF	-Add some air to IfdKey that will allow me
				 to do some snooping in a test release w/o
				 a full release build.

V00-06-00	28Oct98 EDF	-Modify storeAllMarked() to take an enum
				 that controls whether the "need to store"
				 flags in a dictionary get cleared when
				 store is done.  This means you can load
				 a dictionary and then just keep on storing
				 it over and over without having to remark
				 the entries.  I'm not sure this will make
				 sense for all dictionaries.

V00-05-02	29Sep98 EDF	-Add link_ProxyDict.mk

V00-05-01	20Aug98 EDF	-Modify regr. test script.

		???	DNB	-Add AbsArg include to simple proxy dict
				 and mess with online makefiles.

V00-05-00	01Aug98 EDF	-Add new keyKind to IfdKey enumeration for
				 odfTypeKeys.
				-Big reorganization
					o  move much code from inline to
					   out of line, now that CXX 5* is
					   gone.
				-Add IfdNoComplileTest.  This makes sure
				 that template definitions that are not
				 used in regression tests (shame on me)
				 at least get compiled once before release.

DNB-02          09Jun98 DNB     -Update online Makefiles to use wildcard
                                 targets

V00-04-12	30Apr98	DNB	-Move destructors in templated classes to be
				 the first declared function.  This is a workaround
				 for a VxWorks template instantiation bug.

		29Apr98	DNB	-Add 2_segment level. This
				 has no effect on the offline behavior of the
				 package.

		29Apr98 EDF	-Change ints to size_t's and rearrange
				 order of member initializers in SimplePD ctor.


DNB-01		09Apr98	DNB	-Add online Makefile and 0_control level. This
				 has no effect on the offline behavior of the
				 package.

V00-04-11	09Mar98 EDF	-Add missing BaBar.hh includes to .cc files.

V00-04-10	28Jan98 EDF	-Finally get regression tests to run
				 automatically from makefile and have
				 system independent output.

V00-04-09	14Jan98 EDF	-A fix for HP aCC

V00-04-08	14Jan98 EDF	-Fix IfdSimpleProxyDictTest.cc compilation for
				 patched sun compiler. Who knows who was right?
				-Change print method in IfdSimpleProxyDict
				 so that one may select whether or not address-
				 es of proxies and AbsARgs are printed.  This
				 is needed for portable printout for regress-
				 ion test logs.  (What a pain).

V00-04-07	07Jan98 EDF	-Remove all the rcsid and rscid statics
				-Remove class static in IfdCounter.
				-Base IfdCounter on long, not int.
				-Only limited testing done, and only on Sun.

V00-04-06	02Dec97	EDF	-Remove pure virt dtor in IfdTypeKeyIFace
				 since some of our compilers can't deal with
				 it.

V00-04-05	02Dec97 EDF	-Improved debugging of type keys.  Added
			           static char* IfdTypeKey<T>::name( char *)
				   void IfdTypeKeyIFace::dumpName(ostream&)
				 The former may be called to set a name
				 associated with a *whole* class of type
				 keys,
					IfdTypeKey<MyClass>::name("MyClass")
				 This affects the output of print(ostram&)
				 and the output of dumpName(), but is UNRELATED
				 to the operator==() which defines the key
				 behavior.   The dumpName(ostream) is just
				 a print method in the abstract base class
				 that calls print() and then flushes w/ endl;
				 Intended use:  while in a debugger, if
				 you print the value of a type key, the
				 integer value definign op== is printed, which
				 is not so useful for systems debugging.  If
				 you use name() you can associate a name to
				 this to figure out what is what in the code.

				-Moved some impl. of IfdTypeKeyIFace into .cc
		

		20Nov97 SJG	-Makefile fixes to keep .o out of src dir

V00-04-02	07Nov97 NG 	-Refer to elements in base classes explicitly
				 via derivatives this pointer for templated
				 classes.

V00-04-01	04Nov97 EDF	-Remove a print statement.

V00-04-00	17Sep97 EDF	-AbsArgs
				   +Make class data be static data in 
				    getTypeKey to support gcc.
				   +Improve constness:  clone, getTypeKey.
				-Ifd:  move nullArg to a helper function.
				-IfdStrKey:  remove CLHEP/Strings.h
				   +asString now returns char*, not HepString.
				   +Take some methods out of line.
				-IfdTypeKey:  move static into a method.
				   +Rename NO_STATIC_IN_TEMPLATE to be
				    IFDTYPEKEY_SPECIALIZE to refect its new
				    function.
				-Reimplement IfdSimpleProxyDict w/ array
				    rather than CLHEP AList.  Now have no
				    dependency on CLHEP in ProxyDict.


V00-03-04	30Aug97 EDF	-Fix an include from "foo" to "ProxyDict/foo"

V00-03-03	29Aug97 EDF	-Make work on various platforms.  Had troble
				 w/ virtual dtor in templated Ifd<T> on HP.

         	29Aug97 EDF	-Remove pure virtual dtor from 
				 IfdProxyDictFrontEnd for compilation on
				 AIX and HP.  (dtor is virtual now, not pure).

V00-03-02	29Aug97 EDF	-Remove dead code (IfdDictKeyT<T>).

V00-03-01	29Aug97 EDF	-Introduce IfdProxyDictFrontEnd, a base class
				 for Ifd<T>.  Now Ifd<T> is a replaceable
				 component and multiple, application specific,
				 front ends may be written.

V00-03-00	28Aug97 EDF     -Remove requirement that data inherit from
				 IfdData.  Internals are now in terms of void*
				-Add Ifd<T>::put(IfdProxyDict*, T*).  This
				 guy builds an IfdDataProxy for the passed T*.

V00-02-06	02Jul97 EDF	-Fix for compilation on SunOS5
				-add keyUsed(), keyUsed(const IfdKey&)
				-Make IfdSimpleProxyDict::entry into a clas
				-at file level (in separate file).

V00-02-05	12Jun97 EDF	-Add IfdKey* IfdCompositeKey::tail(void).
				-Add HepString IfdStrKey::asString();
					warning:  signature may change.

V00-02-04	09Jun97 DQ/EDF	-Add IfdHepAListProxyTemplate
				-Remove fwd decls from IfdDictKey.

V00-02-03	06Jun97 EDF	-Add migration document
V00-02-02	06Jun97 EDF	-Add test of IfdDataProxyTemplate to test.
				 Fix bug: delete arg after stoareAllMarked()

V00-02-01	04Jun97 EDF	-Fix crash during deletion of IfdSimplePD
				 by remembering to init arg in entry to 0.
				 (Thanks to BobJ).
				-Add test of deletion of IfdSimplePD to tests
V00-02-00	02Jun97	EDF	-Replace NULL with 0 everywhere.
				-IfdDataProxy is no longer the base for
				 making proxies.  IfdDataProxyTemplate is.
				-Extend arg list passed to proxies:
				   faultHandler(IfdProxyDict*, const IfdKey&,
						AbsArg&)
				   storeHandler(IfdProxyDict*, const IfdKey&,
						AbsArg&, T*)
				-Extend Ifd<> interface
				   Extra args may be passed to proxies.
				   markForStore(...)
				   storeItem(...)
				-Modify IfdProxyDict  interface:
				   invalidateProxyCaches() is  now called
				   testProxyCaches().
				-Extend IfdProxyDict interface:
				   markForStore(const IfdDictKey&, AbsArg&)
				   storeAllMarked()
				   storeItem( const IfdDictKey&, AbsArg&)
				-IfdSimpleProxyDict:
				   Implement new mthods from IfdProxyDict
				-Improve testing software
				-Extend IfdCompositeKey:
				   car()    returns head of list as IfdKey*
				   cdr()    returns remainder of list as
					    IfdCompositeKey*

<none>		27May97	EDF	-Add AbsArgs:  type-safe replacement for
				 replacement for void* when no RTTI.

V00-01-12 (??)	05May97 SJG	-Added BaBar.hh to IfdTypeKey for template
				 instantiation on HP. Needed due to a change
				 in Beast.
				-Also fix a mistake in testProxyDict.t file.

V00-01-11	19Apr97 EDF	-Allow get() and put() to take a char*
				 argument, rather than an IfdKey.  We convert
				 the char* to an IfdStrKey to provide
				 a more convenient interface for the user.

V00-01-10	31Mar97 EDF	-Fix gnumakefile for building test sw on
				 OSF by adding -define_templates for 
				 compilation of test sw only.

V00-01-09	13Mar97 SJG	-add #include "ProxyDict/IfdProxyDict.hh"
				 to Ifd.hh
				-add testProxyDict.t file.

V00-01-07	07Mar97 EDF	-change foo(X x) to foo(X) for foo's thta do
				 do not actually use the arg x.  This is to
				 get the HP compile to stfu.
				-reduce the maximum size of a composit key
				 from 16 to 4 for space reasons.

V00-01-06	24Feb97 EDF	-add invalildateProxyCaches().
				 Luca's fixes for HP "not used" msgs.
V00-01-05	13Feb97 EDF	-Move copy ctor for compositeKey to .cc
				 .  No longer inline.  Needed for HP.

V00-01-04	12Feb97 EDF	-IfdData dtor in .cc file.  Use this tag
				 for first system build on AIX.

V00-01-03	08Feb97 EDF	-Fix a decl found by cxx.

V00-01-02	07Feb97 EDF	-Try to get reasonable copy and assignment
				 ops for *all* classes.  For the most part,
				 these operations are never allowed in Ifd
				 classes.

V00-01-01	07Feb97 EDF	-Compiles, links, and passes tests on
				 g++ 2.7.2.2 (morgan10).

V00-01-00	07Feb97 EDF	-Adopt filenames following TLA "Ifd" for
				 "Interface Dictionary."  Nothing compiles.
				 All documentation is wrong.  This will be
				 the base of our repairs.  Have mercy, CVS.

V00-00-09	07Feb97 EDF	-A tag prior to fixing up TLA naming

V00-00-08	28Jan97 EDF	-compiles on DEC, HPUX, AIX.  Readme file
				 is non-negligible, but still not enough
				 for someone to read it and use PD.
				 We're releaseing this tag.

V00-00-07	28Jan97 EDF	-Same as V00-00-06, but mods for HP-UP
				 (hep4.llnl.gov)

V00-00-06	28Jan97 EDF	-Same as V00-00-05 but w/ simple mods
				 for AIX4/xlC compilation (morgan04)

V00-00-05       28Jan97 EDF	-Change to dictFE<T> front end.
				-Add get/put with no 2ndary key.
				-Create PDHepAList and proxy for it along
				 with Test program.  This will all move
				 to AbsEvent soon.
				-Works on DEC OSF1V4.0 cxx V5.4-006 (online01)
				-Readme file is now out of date but I want to
				 release.

V00-00-04       03Dec96 EDF     -A version that runs on all of our platforms.

V00-00-03	29Nov96	EDF	-A version that runs on HP-UX B.10.20 using
				 HP C++ HPCPLUSPLUS A.10.22.  Tested on
				 HP-UX hep4 B.10.20 A 9000/780 2005911167
				 a.k.a, hep4.llnl.gov.

V00-00-02	22Nov96	EDF	-A version that runs on OSF 4.0 using
