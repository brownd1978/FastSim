Overview:
---------

The new event design changes the way you obtain data from the event.  In
the Old AbsEvent, all data lists were hardwired in.  Doing "new
AbsEvent" yielded an object with all BaBar lists, and all of these lists
were empty.  In the new AbsEvent, which is based on the ProxyDict
package, NO lists are hardwired in.  Doing "new AbsEvent" yields an
object that is completely empty.  This does not mean the event has empty
lists like above.  It means there are no lists at all.  Some agent must
put lists into the event before any other agent can get them back out
again.

So, both the operation of the event and the semantics for obtaining data
from the event have changed.  This note is a set of recipes for
migrating to the new event design, a migration that will take place over
the coming weeks.


Status of the Event Migration
-----------------------------

We have been using the new event design, hidden behind a migration
interface, on all releases using the native compiler since about 3.1.2.
Also, the MDC1 ran using the new event design, hidden behind a migration
interface, so we know it functions.  It is time to remove the migration
interface and force all BaBar modules to use the new interface so that
we can realize our objective of removing the inter-package couplings
caused by the old AbsEvent design.


Access to Data
--------------
   Old AbsEvent:
	HepAList<Stuff>* l = ev->getStuffAList();

   New AbsEvent:
	HepAList<Stuff>* l = Ifd< HepAList<Stuff> >::get( ev );

   Migration:
	-You must change every ev->getX to the new Ifd<T>::get( event )
	 form in your code.

   Comments:
	-In the new event design, it is possible to request data
	 that are not in the event.  In that case, a NULL is returned.

	-As a warning, note carefully the space between the two
	 closing right angles, ">".  Many compilers insist on this space.
	 Compare:
	   HepAList<Stuff>* l = Ifd<HepAList<Stuff> >::get( ev );
	   HepAList<Stuff>* l = Ifd<HepAList<Stuff>>::get( ev );
	 The second of these is likely  not to compile.

	-If you have data in the event that are not HepALists, please
	 send a note and I will help you.

Adding a new List:
------------------

   Old AbsEvent:
	Edit AbsEvent.cc, declare a new HepAList<NewStuff>* _aListNewStuff
	member and a HepAList<NewStuff>* getNewStuffList() method.

   New AbsEvent:
	The new event is much richer than the old because it allows
	you to put data into the event without recompilation and
	without playing with the InputModule.  Data may be added to
	the event at any time, in any module, i.e., it may be done
	outside of the InputModule.

	Recall that the new event is a dictionary and that it does
	not store the data directly.  Instead, it stores agents
	called proxies and the proxies are responsible for managing
	the data.  When you do an Ifd<T>::get(), the dictionary
	looks up the corresponding proxy, and forwards the get() to
	the proxy.  While this allows a great deal of flexibility,
	here we will only show how to add a new HepAList to the
	event.  If you have other needs, please tell me and I will
	tell you how to proceed.

	To add a new list to the event you do the following steps.
		1.  create the list.
		2.  create a proxy, passing the new list as an
			argument in the constructor.
		3.  add the proxy to the event.
	Note that step (2) passes ownership of the list to the
	proxy, and that step (3) passes ownership of the proxy
	to the dictionary.  Thus, you should NOT call operator
	delete on either the list or the proxy, even though
	you did the call to operator new.

	The code to do these steps is as follows:
	   #include "AbsEvent/AbsEvent.hh"
   	   #include "ProxyDict/IfdHepAListProxy.hh"

	   HepAList<Stuff>      *list = new HepAList<Stuff>;
	   IfdHepAListProxy<Stuff) *proxy= new IfdHepAListProxy<Stuff>(list);
	   Ifd< HepAList<Stuff> >::put( ev, proxy );
	The three lines of code correspond to the three steps described
	in the previous paragraph.

	Several things should be noted.
	        1.  <overcome by events>

		2.  The put() method returns a boolean which is true when
		    the list was added successfully, and false otherwise.
		    For brevity sake, I did not show a test on the
		    return value, but it is wise to do so.

		3.  You may only store one item of a given type and
		    given secondary key (see below concerning secondary
		    keys).  If you try to put in two, then the put()
		    will return 'false.'  In this case, the attempt to
		    store the second one is guaranteed to leave the
		    first one unharmed.

		4.  You should think about where (what module) to place
		    this call to put().  This is discussed below.

		5.  I suggest that you add _empty_ lists to the
		    event, and then do manipulations later, rather
		    then filling up a list first and then putting it into
		    the event.  Right now, it really does not matter
		    which you do, but if you have a choice, add the
		    empty list, then manipulate it.


Where to do the put()
---------------------
	In the old event design, lists were owned by the event and were
	created in its constructor.  In the new event, anyone can create
	a list, and then pass ownership of the list to the event.
	The question then arises, where should the call to put() be
	done?  In particular, should it be done within a subsystem's
	collection of modules, or should it be done within the
	InputModule.  To answer this, it must first be pointed out
	that there are really two different kinds of data:  there are
	those that are read in from disk (persistent data) and there
	are those that are "scratch space," and that just allow
	modules to communicate with one another.  I call these
	lists "temporary lists."  At present, almost every single
	list in the event is a temporary list, with the 10 or so
	dbio lists being the only exceptions.

	Temporary lists should, if at all possible, be added to the event
	within the subsystem modules that use the data.  There is usually
	one module that is known to run first that can take on
	the responsibility of adding the list to the event.

	The alternative	is to have the APPFileInputModule add the list.
	The problem here is that the InputModule then becomes dependent
	on every one of the lists that it adds, and thus causes
	applications that link against it to pull in code that the
	application does not need.

	At present, the APPFileInputModule adds all the lists that were
	in the old event.  We would like to move as many of these as
	we can out of the InputModule.

	When we begin to support persistence of data, then this recipe
	will necessarily change.  Persistent lists really ought to be
	added by an InputModule, and not by the subsystem modules.
	We will need to revisit this in the future.

Secondary Keys
--------------
	When you do a put or a get, e.g., 

		Ifd<T>::get(ev)
		Ifd<T>::put(ev, proxy)

	the Ifd class maps the class name, T, onto a key that is
	used to access the dictionary.  This is the primary key for
	searching.  If you need to store more than one list of a given
	kind, then you must provide a secondary key.  We suggest
	the use of a string.  The calls then look like the following:

		Ifd<T>::get( ev, "someString" );
		Ifd<T>::put( ev, proxy, "someString");

	Note that the type, T, and the secondary key must be 
	identical between the get() and put() calls.  Also note that
	the secondary key is not required, and may be omitted
	in cases where there is no degeneracy, or for the default
	item in a degenerate case.  

	To avoid hardwiring these strings into your code, we provide
	an AbsParm so that you may control this secondary key from Tcl.
	The AbsParm is called AbsParmIfdStrKey and an example of its
	usage is given in FrameExample/ParmExample.cc.  In typical usage,
	a module would own one of these, e.g.,
		AbsParmIfdStrKey	key;  // in the .hh file of the module

	and then  the module would use it via
		Ifd<T>::get( ev, key.value() );
	   or	Ifd<T>::put( ev, proxy, key.value());
	
	Users would set the key value in a Tcl file via
		module talk MyModule
		   key set someString
		exit


Writing New Proxies
-------------------
	The proxies provide polymorphism for the new event, and
	are responsible for fetching the associated data.  Because
	they are called only when the user requests data, they can
	be used to defer and cache expensive computations, using
	the users request for them as the stimulus that causes the
	work to be done.

	I will defer giving a description of writing a new proxy
	for another time:  we are still settling that right now.
	If there is something you need to do, please send me mail,
	and I will help you to do it.
