Revision 1.33  2007/02/13 05:44:08  salnikov
- added Framework action which prints the number of consumed seeds for
  each framework module


Revision 1.32  2006/10/05 07:13:26  swaban
 Oct 6, 2006, Swagato V00-05-02: Changed default # of events per run to 10000.

Revision 1.31  2002/05/15 05:24:19  abi
Corrected error message when generating more events than are allowed per run.

Revision 1.30  2002/05/15 05:10:55  abi
Updated History

Oct 6, 2006, Swagato V00-05-02: Changed default # of events per run to 10000.

May 14, 2002, Abi (V00-02-03)
----------------------------------
Corrected error message when generating more events than are allowed per run.


May 14, 2002, Abi (V00-02-02)
----------------------------------
- RunCongif::RunClass parameters now settable in RacRandomControl tcl commands.
- Removed array of RunClasses, leaving only one.
- Changed default run range from 0 to 166,000,000.
- Changed default # of events per run to 2000.
- Printing error and aborting (unless _abortOnPrimaryOverConsumption is false)
  if generating more events than are allowed per run.

Revision 1.29  2002/03/27 22:21:33  salnikov
- fix problems after Framework migration from FwkString to std:;string


Revision 1.28  2002/03/25 21:53:50  salnikov
- STL migration, all RW classes replaced
- some cosmetic changes


February 1, 2002, Andy (V00-01-18)
----------------------------------
  - greedy runs were not greedy at all:) Now they are. Use 50M of 
    seeds per event.
  - Need to update docs

January 15, 2002, Andy (V00-01-17)
----------------------------------
  - reduce the noise from event-level printing

January 3, 2002, Andy (V00-01-16)
---------------------------------
  - add the "greedy" run class, which uses huge number of seeds in generators.
  - update postscript file in doc/

October 17, 2001, Andy (V00-01-15)
----------------------------------
  - fix to compile in 11.4.0 release, some migration stuff was left over

November 1, 2000, Andy (V00-01-14)
----------------------------------
  - extend the idea to the analysis (and reco) stages, where there is no
    run/event number. For this purpose I reserve upper quarter of the 
    ranecu sequence (whole sequence is 2^60) for the "Reco" and "Analysis"
    stages. Positioning inside this subsequence is done based on the event
    time (odfBinTime, to reduce overlap between consequent events I reverse 
    bit order in the time before skipping). 
  - engines for simulation stages ("Primary", "Simulation", "Digis") are put
    in the event only when GEvent is present in the AbsEvent. "Reco" and 
    "Analysis" stages are put in the event only when AbsEventID is present
    in the AbsEvent.
  - new class RacEidConfig defines "Reco" and "Analysis" stages and 
    algorithm to skip seeds for these stages.
  - new module RacEidMaker to create EventID from GEvent. This is a copy of 
    the EidSim's module with some stuff removed to get rid of the dependencies.
  - cout and cerr replaced with ErrMsg everywhere.

October 12, 2000. Asoka De Silva (V00-01-13)
--------------------------------------------
Overloaded inputEvent method in RacTestInput to stop OSF from generating
warnings.  Also ran slow migration script (Framework/FwkMigate_v3 - please
see script for details.)

July 24, 2000. Abi Soffer (V00-01-12)
--------------------------------------
RacRandomControl::event clears the RandGauss cache by calling
RandGauss::setFlag(false);
at the end of the event() function (Dave Williams). This is needed
for bogus, which uses RandGauss, and would otherwise result in 
irreproducibility.

May 31, 2000. Abi Soffer (V00-01-11)
------------------------------------
  - abortOnOverConsumption changed to abortOnPrimaryOverConsumption
    and only causes an abort if the Primary stage uses more seeds than
    allowed for one event. Clarified error messages a little. Introduced
    tcl parameter _reportNumSeedsUsed to print out # of seeds used on 
    each event (false by default). Whatever's printed to seed-overuse.tx
    is now also printed to ErrMsg(error).


May 12, 2000. A.Salnikov (V00-01-10)
------------------------------------
  - Added a Tcl parameterto RandControl module - abortOnOverConsumption. With 
    this set to true job will abort when the seed consumption pers stage exceeds 
    the max allowed number of randoms per event. When false it will print a message
    in seed-overuse.txt.

May 11, 2000. A.Salnikov (V00-01-09)
------------------------------------
  - Change the order of randoms inside run, now they sweep across all stages of
    event, as opposed to the old behaviour, when they went through all events
    in one stage before going to next stage.

Apr 28, 2000. A. Soffer (V00-01-08)
-----------------------------------
  - Framework migration: commands()->append(x) => commands()->append(&x)

Sep 07, 1999. A Ryd (V00-01-06)
-------------------------------
  - Allow for up to 3,000,000 random numbers per full event with a 40%
    fraction for the digi mixer.

Jun 05, 1999. S.Gowdy
---------------------
  - Change to use 64bit support from BaBar.hh instead of own (doesn't work
    on Linux).

May 04, 1999. G.Cosmo (V00-01-04)
---------------------------------
  - Added Andrei's original documentation (PS file). Created doc/
    directory.

Dec 23, 1998. A.Soffer (V00-01-03)
----------------------------------
  - The first event number can now be set in Tcl. This enables checking
    the integrity of the random seeds using GqaRandCheck, which is very
    for trapping stray random number generators in the fortran event
    generators. Updated RacTestInput module.

Dec 19, 1998. G.Cosmo (V00-01-02)
---------------------------------
  - Updated RacRanecuEngine according to the new CLHEP random
    classes.

Dec 5, 1998. G.Dubois-Felsmann (V00-01-01)
------------------------------------------
  - Corrected format of link_RandControl.mk file.

Oct 1, 1998. G.Cosmo (V00-01-00)
--------------------------------
  - Framework migration: updated RacRandomControl, RacRandomPicker
    and RacTestInput classes.

Apr 24, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-08)
-----------------------------------
  - fix in the order of parameters to skip() in RacRandomControl. Run
    number and stage number were mixed.

Apr 8, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-07)
-----------------------------------
  - small unimportant changes to RacRunConfig class to make all
    compilers happy.

Apr 7, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-06)
-----------------------------------
  - move testRanecuSkipper executable and test file in the test/
    subdirectory. Great simplification of the GNUmakefiles.

Apr 2, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-05)
-----------------------------------
  - Add this package in PackageList, update GNUmakefile and
    link_RandControl.mk

Apr 2, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-04)
-----------------------------------
  - Some changes in CLHEP/Random needed changes in RacRanecuEngine
    also, in the way how it access the seedTable[]
  - Add package name to makefile's 'echo "Linking..."'

Mar 30, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-03)
------------------------------------
  - Add RacModules() function - analog of the XxxSequence() - which
    creates RandomControl module and four RandomPicker modules "on
    behalf" of the calling AppUserBuild class.
  - testRandControl.tcl script added to make a simple framework from
    the things built in the AppUsrBuild.cc

Mar 30, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-02)
------------------------------------
  - Adding randControl.tcl which defines randControl function, which has
    some logic inside it, which installs RandomControl and RandomPicker
    modules, which ...

Mar 27, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-01)
------------------------------------
  - Fix for the absence of the setbase() manipulator in cxx.

Mar 27, 1998. A.Salnikov (V00-00-00)
------------------------------------
  - First release. Importing it into SRT.
  - I do not put it into PackageList today, will do it only after the
    next BaBar release.
