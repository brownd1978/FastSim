15/01/10 - R. Stroili
	split code in src and include directories

24/09/07 - I. Gaponenko (V02-10-14)
	CLHEP migration: replaced forward declarations for CLHEP classes with
	direct includes of the corresponding header files. The modification
	is backward compatible with the old version of CLHEP.
	Also made a trivial fix in file TrkHelixUtils.cc to avoid an ambiguity
	between a locally declared variable 'pi' and the one 'Constants::pi'
	which comes from the CLHEP library. The new version of the library brings
	its 'pi' into the global namespace with 'using' statement which results
	in a conflict with the locally declared copy of 'pi'. The modification
        is backward compatible with the old version of CLHEP.

17/05/07 - M. Kelsey
	TrkPocaVertex.cc, TrkPrimaryVertex.cc:  Both of these files are
	  missing the required BaBar.hh as first-include.

[ Nothing documented since 2005 ]
 
12/06/05 - M. Kelsey (V02-12-04)

11/27/05 - M. Kelsey
	Make TrkHitOnTrkIter typedef's public instead of private (MacOSX).
 
09/10/04 - R. Bartoldus (V02-07-01)
	Insert a missing #include <math.h>.
	Remove "rscid" statics.

10/30/03 - S. Gowdy
	Added dummy vector in TrkHotListDataTest.cc so that it compiles.
	Probably doesn't work though and someone who knows what they are
	doing should probably fix it (TrkHotListEmpty now has this as
	part of the constructor).

09/10/03 - M. Kelsey (grazie G. Raven)
	TrkFundHit:  Change setUsedHit and related functions to take const
	  HOT argument.  Requires recompilation of all packages which use
	  TrkFundHit directly:

	DchData		DchReco		JetNet		SvtData
	SvtReco		TrkDataP	TrkDchHitAdd	TrkHitAdd
	TrkKinkTests

06/24/02 - E. Charles:
        TrkExpectedHotSet.cc: protect against null point in test which track to  	  match.
 
06/24/02 - E. Charles:
        TrkExpectedHotSet.cc: get rid of improperly stl-migrated vector 
          initialization.  Was being initiliazed with 5 junk hits.  

06/10/02 - E. Charles
	TrkExpectedHot:  Added ability to make expected hots from gHits.  This
	  required added functions to determine type of expected hot so that
	  type of gHit would be known.  Also added pointer to parent expected
          track for convience.
 	TrkExpectedHotSet:  Added ability to determine if HotSet is Svt or Dch
	  as above.
	TrkExpectedHotFactory:  Added map filling methods bases on GHit.  Also
	  added a map to determine if a particular hit is used during the
	  pat-rec algorithm.  
	TrkExpectedMap:  Added maps for GHit and GTracks.
	TrkExpectedTrk:  Added ptr to associated gTrack.
 	TrkSimpTraj:  Moved location of declaration of _theOrigin to top of
	  file so that it gets seen by the compiler before it gets used.  This
	  is esp. needed for CINT.  
 
05/22/02 - M. Kelsey (V02-00-10)
	TrkRep.cc:  Modify base version of resid(...,exclude) to eliminate
	  the assertion.  Instead, utilize the boolean return value to
	  flag whether the residual and error exist and are trustworthy.
	  Allows calling of HOT::resid() function from mini-cache tracks,
	  without crashing executable.

05/13/02 - M. Kelsey (V02-00-09)
	TrkHitList:  Change "cerr" to "ErrMsg(warning)" so that we can see
	  which modules are responsible for using the old list accessors.
	  Add private "quietRWList" accessor without the warning messages,
	  so that TrkHitListIterImpl and TrkHitList::end() don't generate
	  the error messages themselves.

05/02/02 - M. Kelsey (V02-00-08)
	Remove size argument from TrkFitStatus::_history ctor.

04/17/02 - M. Kelsey
	Add print, printAll, and operator<< functions to TrkExchangePar.
	Fix date stamps below (Roberto's last one was ambiguous, and we all
	chose the wrong "01" to be the year :-)

12/25/01 - M. Kelsey
	Fix TrkFitStatus::printHistory() to terminate lines with endl, not
	with endmsg.

10/29/01 - M. Kelsey
	Add TrkErrCode::setMessage() to allow changing string without
	changing status code or success/failure.

08/14/01 - W. Ford
	Remove null definition of mutable for XLC compiler.
 
01/06/01 - R. Stroili
	remove function TrkHitOnTrk::dchHit()

10/05/00 - S. Wagner
        Move HelixTraj, NeutParams, NeutTraj, TrkCompTrk, TrkHelixUtils, 
        TrkMomCalculator, TrkMomVisitor from TrkFitter. Remove default
        (=0) BField option in TrkCompTrk c-tor, so no depend on TrkEnv, AbsEnv.
06/16/00 -- M. Kelsey (V01-02-04)
	Add new TrkFundHit::printAll() function which prints hit info
	plus list of all HOTs which use this hit.  Useful for debugging
	TrkHitAdd stuff.  SvtHit doesn't have a print() function yet.

NO COMMENTS FOR ANY CHANGES BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE!  ARGH!

04/20/00 -- M. Kelsey (MHK-V00-01-03-01)
	Remove terminating endl in TrkErrCode::print() (.cc ONLY!)

04/17/00 -- G. Raven
       o Make TrkDifPoca & TrkPoca more "identical"
       o Change interface of TrkHitList::appenList to accept a RW vector
         instead of a HepAList
       o Change interface of TrkHitOnTrk: make it const correct -- the only
         member to change state is 'updateMeasurement'. (cached) Fit information
         (chi, derivatives) are retrieved using 'getFitStuff'.
       o Add method to TrkHitOnTrk to access unbiased residuals (i.e. residuals
         which are computed without the hit under question part of the track)
       o Add 'updatePoca' method to allow more code sharing between DCH & SVT
         HitOnTrack implementation
       o Add methods in TrkHitOnTrk which basically allow a dynamic cast to 
         DCH & SVT HitOnTrack to avoid code that blindly casts.
       o Add access control to TrkHitOnTrk::updateMeasurements: anyone who wants
         to call this needs to inherit from TrkHitOnTrkUpdater
       o Check for valid pointer to TrkRep in TrkRecoTrk::hits before dereferencing it
       o Minor speedup in TrkRep::positionErr
       o Add a virtual 'resid' function to TrkRep which allows access to unbiased
         residuals (which is used by TrkHitOnTrk)
       o Add operator== to TrkSimpTraj to allow caching in TrkHitOnTrk

03/13/00 -- J. Albert (jea-03-13-00a)
       Removed dynamic allocation of _dtparams in TrkSimpTraj.

01/30/00 -- E. Charles (eac013100)
       Added TrkExpectedMap classes and support. 

01/05/00 -- J. Albert (jea-01-05-00)
       Equivalent POCA changes in TrkDifPoca to the ones in TrkPoca

12/28/99 -- M. Kelsey (MHK-991228)
	Add TrkDirection.cc with operator<< to print direction names.

11/30/99 -- J. Albert (jea-11-29-99, jea-11-29-99nixErrMsg)
       Bug fix to the fix below.  Also limit the kink "overhangs" to
       1/1000 the precision rather than 1/10.

11/29/99 -- J. Albert (jea-11-29-99)
       Attempt to fix some of the POCA errors we get:

       traj-to-point POCA: make sure second derivative is positive -- if
       not, go the other way.  Make tiny oscillation a trace message (as 
       it is completely normal), if larger oscillation is detected, try
       halfway point, if that fails twice, exit with a warning.
       traj-to-traj POCA: make sure Jacobian is positive -- if not, and if
       the predicted step is the opposite sign of delta-dot-dir term, go
       the other way.  Also, if the distance is larger than the distance
       of the previous step, try going the other way if that is an
       improvement.
       both: make some HepPoints & Hep3Vectors static, increase number of 
       iterations before failure to 50 (helps when traj has many pieces).

8/23/99  -- D. Brown
	Add ambiguity functions to TrkHitOnTrk, virtual with default
	implementations (to show no ambiguity).  The DchHot functions
	of the same name now overload these base-class functions.

4/5/99   -- S. Schaffner
	Several changes for optimization.  Modify TrkDifPieceTraj to 
   	cache previously visited piece and start from that.  Added 
	getDfInfo2() (w/ stupid default behavior) for faster difNumber 
	access to trajs.  TrkFundHit now stores its list of hots in a
	RW list.

1/10/99  -- S. Schaffner
	Moved TrkVisitor here from TrkFitter.

1/7/99   -- S. Schaffner
	Moved Trajectory and TrkGeomTraj to BbrGeom.  Left forwarding headers
	here for next release.  Also moved BbrHelixTraj and TrkPieceTraj.

11/23/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Change various consts in TrkRecoTrk, TrkExtInterface, and TrkFitMaker
	to permit TrkDataP to keep working.

11/20/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Finish ErrLogger migration.

11/19/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add some protected print statements to TrkRecoTrk, TrkRep.  Add 
	operator=() to Trajectory.  Migrate cout to ErrLogger (cerr still 
	to come).  Add new class BbrHelixTraj -- should move somewhere else 
	soon.

9/24/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkHitUse to the TrkHitList interface.

9/?/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Add new class TrkHitUse, for input of hits into tracks (will 
	eventually replace TrkHitOnTrk for that purpose).  Abstract base class.

9/8/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Add localTrajectory() to TrkAbsFit.  Remove dummy implementation of 
	vertexing functions in TrkAbsFit and make pure virtual.  Remove 
	TrkAbsFit::arrivalTime() and TrkAbsFit::particleType() (now pure
	virtuals in TrkFit).  

8/21/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove TrkContext data member from TrkRecoTrk -- id manager now 
	carried by TrkId.  Make TrkIdManager abstract.  Make TrkContext 
	abstract.  Gut TrkId: remove statics and value calculation, add 
	ptr to id manager.

Release 6.10.0

7/22/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove cloning of hots in TrkRep copy ctor (moved to derived classes, 
	so Kal can manipulate hots as it clones them -- this was the original 
	design, which got lost somewhere along the way).

7/21/98 -- J. Albert
        Added TrkAbsFit class as abstract class for TrkFit and for
        TrkCompTrk.

Release 6.9.0

7/6/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Removed default id manager argument from TrkContext ctor; removed 
	BABAR_EPSILON from TrkDifPoca.cc and TrkHitOnTrk.cc; move 
	setCurrent(false) when updating hotss from TrkRecoTrk to TrkRep;
	add accessor function to BField in TrkRecoTrk; remove cached 
	TrkContext pointer from TrkRep -- navigate via TrkRecoTrk.

6/30/98 -- J. Albert
        Made momentum functions in TrkRep purely virtual, as the derived
        class TrkSimpleRep now uses the momentum visitor functions (see
        TrkFitter 6/30/98 History entry).  Modified TrkSimpTraj to 
        virtually accept a visitor.

6/24/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Removed migration path from TrkFitMaker -- createTrack now requires 
	a TrkContext argument.  Renamed non-const version of TrkRecoTrk::
	context().  Added TrkContext::operator==().  Made TrkRep::nSvt(), etc 
	non-inlined (they became virtual somewhere along the way).

6/23/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Removed time from TrkContext, added it to TrkRecoTrk and TrkFitMaker.
	Added TrkRecoTrk::updateRep.  Provided ugly kludge (default value) 
	for migration to bunch time in TrkFitMaker.

5/26/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove 5/13 change to TrkFundHit dtor (it's already done in the 
	derived classes, dolt).  (Did change the implementation in the 
 	derived classes -- no longer remove hots while iterating over list.) 
	Fix a couple of BField includes.  Add protection to 
	TrkHitList::removeHit if the hit isn't on the list; also add bool 
	return.  Move initialization of _defaultType in TrkRecoTrk 
	copy ctor, assignment op higher up, so track is in better-defined 
	state when hots are added.

5/13/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add to TrkFundHit dtor: removes hit from tracks.

 5/1/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkRecoTrk::addHypoTo; add function to TrkFitMaker to permit 
	FitMakers to monkey with BField (or anything else in the TrkContext).
	Fix bug in resetT0() (should have been incrementing fitNumber for 
	all particle types, not for all existing reps).

4/30/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove TrkContext ctor(AbsEvent) (moved to derived class in TrkFitter).

4/28/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add the implementation of TrkRep::updateHots(), which seems to 
	have disappeared (via TrkHotList::updateHots()).  Add TrkContext, 
	with BField, t0 and TrkIdManager pointers.  Modify TrkRecoTrk to 
	take TrkContext as argument to ctor, modify TrkFitMaker to provide it, 
	and provide migration path that still accepts bunch time.

4/21/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkRep::updateHots(), with default implementation, and 
	same function in TrkHotList classes.

4/17/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkIdManager -- currently just a shell around TrkId static 
	functions.

4/11/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Modify TrkRecoTrk and TrkId to permit id's to be set by persistent 
	tracks. 

 4/2/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Protect TrkPocaBase against zero or negative precision.  Create new 
	class TrkEnums and more TrkViewInfo there; remove trkViewInfo.hh.  

3/30/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Implement TrkRep::arrivalTime().

3/27/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add t0 (bunch time) to TrkRecoTrk and TrkRep, with functions for 
	accessing, resetting, etc.  Require time argument when creating 
	tracks with TrkFitMaker.

3/25/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove TrkBaseTrk.	

3/23/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Eliminate old (unsplit) TrkRecoTrk interface.

 3/4/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add protection against invoking TrkRecoTrk::addFit() on tracks w/o 
	hits.

 3/3/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove chisq from TrkParams.

2/27/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Change static member data to static variables in static member 
	functions in TrkPocaBase.

 2/2/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Change TrkRecoTrk::fitResult() to return pointer instead of reference.
	Now test on validity of fit before returning TrkFit or HitList.

1/28/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkRep::printType().

1/26/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Make TrkHotList into an abstract base class; add derived classes 
	TrkHotListEmpty and TrkHotListFull, for tracks with and without 
	hits.  Move implementations of some functions (e.g. startFoundRange())
	to TrkHotList (all functions that require different implementations 
	for tracks without stored hits); add call-downs to TrkRep.hh  
	Add nDch() and nSvt() to TrkFit, TrkRep and (implementation) 
	TrkHotList.  Remove all knowledge of TrkHotList from TrkRecoTrk.
	Add hitCapable() to TrkRep.
	Add setFitNumber() to TrkRecoTrk.
	Add repointHypo() to TrkRecoTrk.
	Remove dependence on TrkRep.hh from TrkRecoTrk.hh
	Remove changeFit() from TrkFitMaker (not universally required in 
	derived classes).

1/20/98  Tag as V00-05-01

1/12/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Completed break-up of TrkRecoTrk interface: supply mechanism for 
	getting rep-specific interfaces.  To wit, a new abstract class, 
	TrkExtInterface, which communicates with TrkReps by means of an 
	IfdKey, to determine that the two match; also added function to 
	TrkRecoTrk to attach the interfaces.  The only function to 
	be accessed this way right now is extendThrough (implemented in 
	KalmanTrack).  

1/9/98   -- S. Schaffner
	More break-up of TrkRecoTrk: the main interface has been moved 
	to a new class, TrkFit, and access to TrkFit provided in TrkRecoTrk.
	All of the moved functions are now implemented in TrkRecoTrk by 
	passing through to TrkFit.

1/6/98   -- S. Schaffner
	Begin break-up of TrkRecoTrk interface: created two new classes, 
	TrkHitList and TrkFitStatus, to encapsulate parts of interface.  
	Moved all appropriate functions to the new classes; functions still 
	exist in RecoTrk, but only as call-downs to the new classes.

1/1/98   -- D. Brown
	Add fltlen parameter to changeParam function, to avoid
	ambiguities in changing parameter reference point.  This affects 
	ALL TrkSimpTraj subclasses.
  
12/15/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Small change to TrkRecoTrk::whichfit() -- now returns
	PdtPid::null if there is no rep present.  This situation should only
	occur while creating tracks from Beast.

12/08/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Add dependence on BField package.  Tagged as V00-04-16 (V00-04-15 
	had everything but dependence change.)

12/0?/97 -- A. Snyder
	Moved BField to BField package; left shell of header behind.

12/01/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Move enum for parameter indices within class declaration in 
	TrkExchangePar.  Add ctor from SymMatrix.

12/01/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Misc. minor fixes suggested by CodeWizard (removing virtual 
	inlined functions, making one dtor virtual . . .).
	Moved all support for TrkRecoTrk::fitNumber() into TrkRecoTrk itself, 
	and out of the reps.

11/21/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Make TrkGeomTraj::accept() no longer pure virtual.

11/19/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove bbBField.

11/12/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Modify TrkMomDeriv and TrkPosDeriv to accept a trajectory instead 
	of a track as input.

11/7/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Provide more direct access to guts of TrkPieceTraj to permit visitors 
	to function.

11/6/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Create new abstract Trajectory class, TrkGeomTraj, as base class 
	for all non-differential trajs.  Only function at present: accept() 
	(for Visitor pattern).

11/3/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Make TrkRep::cloneNewHypo non-const to keep CodeWizard from getting 
	into such a snit.

11/3/97 -- S. Schaffner 
	Moved TrkCompTrk to TrkFitter to avoid cyclic dependency.

11/3/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Enums moved into classes in TrkErrCode and TrkHelixParams.

10/31/91 -- V. Miftakov
	Created TrkCompTrk.

10/27/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Create TrkBaseTrk as base class to TrkRecoTrk, and modify latter.
	Tighten test on parallelism in TrkPocaBase to catch borderline 
	cases.

10/22/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Make TrkHitOnTrk::updateFitStuff() return TrkErrCode.
	Remove TrkRecoTrk::fitExists().

10/20/97 -- D. Brown
	-Trajectory.hh:
  	 Added prototype (with default implementation) for printAll
  	 made print and printAll virtual
	-TrkSimpTraj.hh:
  	 Added sensible print and printAll functions
	-TrkDifPieceTraj.hh,TrkDifPieceTraj.cc
  	 Improved append function, and added a corresponding prepend
  	 There are still some failures, but MUCH fewer than before

10/15/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkRecoTrk::whichFit(hypo), which tells particle type of fit 
	currently being used for type hypo.  Modify TrkRecoTrk::addFit() 
	to permit refitting even when that hypo is already pointing at a 
	fit.  Add automatic fit when invoking addFit().

10/10/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Added new classes (TrkMomDeriv and TrkPosDeriv) for calculating
	derivative matrix (trk params wrt momentum and position).  Fixed two
	more Poca bugs: add a bit to step in TrkPocaBase::steToPointPoca to
	keep from getting stuck at kinks, and moved calculation of
	distance-to-error after calculation of which direction we should be
	moving in.  Both fixes were already in one place in the code, but not
	in similar spots elsewhere (no doubt a sign of poor design).

10/?/97 -- S. Schaffner
	More Poca fixes: extend step slightly for point-poca, and get order
	of calculations right (same fixes were already in elsewhere in code).

10/1/97 -- S.Schaffner
	Yet another improvement to TrkDifPoca.  In case of point of closest
	approach being at a cusp point on a piecewise trajectory, do something
	sensible in the case that the piecewise trajectory is not the DifTraj,
	and something desperate in the case that it is the DifTraj (after all,
	how *are* you supposed to take derivatives of a piecewise function?).

10/1/97 -- D. Brown
        Made TrkSimpTraj parameters reference point an explicit data member.  
        This can now be specified at construction time, defaulted to the 
	origin.  Along with this are (virtual) functions to translate the 
	parameters and covariance matrix to another reference point.  Also 
	simplified the TrkDifPieceTraj append method to use pocas, not 
	difpocas.

9/29/97 - S. Schaffner
	Fixed bugs in TrkDifPoca and TrkPoca.cc.  Oscillation test now
	looks for tiny steps in either trajectory; when it finds an
	oscillation, picks the likely cusp (based on smaller distToError) and
	does a point-traj poca to that point.  Also increased the number of
	tiny steps needed for oscillation test to 5.

9/22/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Added nDof() to TrkRecoTrk (and pure virtual call-down to TrkRep). 
	Removed "alleged oscillation" warning from Pocas.  Modified TrkHotList
	deleteHits() to delete from the AList, instead of the RW list -- 
	was getting bizarre crash with latter  -- revisit this.  Removed 
	updateResid(), setResid from TrkHitOnTrk, made resid() non-cached, 
	and changed the meaning of arguments in updateFitStuff -- 
	deltaChisq -> deltaChi, and derivs now of deltaChi instead of resid.
	Also added 2nd updateFitStuff, without derivs.
	Fixed calculation of doca for parallel trajectories.

8/27/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Restore foundRange functions for now -- they weren't supposed to 
	disappear until warnings had been issued.

8/21/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Get rid of finite/infinite range distinction in Trajectories; default
	now really big range.  Changes (unspecified) from Dave Brown in 
	piecewise trajectories -- permit DifPieceTraj to be used directly by 
	Kalman.  Remove start and endFoundRange() from 
	TrkRecoTrk.  Make extendThrough() return TrkErrCode.  Remove 
	operator+ and information matrix from TrkParams (and base class 
	in difAlgebra).

8/5/97  -- S. Schaffner
	Add BaBar.hh to TrkFundHit.hh (added to TrkHitOnTrk.hh last week).

7/29/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Back out extendThrough change for now.  Move localTrajectory from 
	DifPieceTraj to DifTraj, and implement for SimpTraj.

7/28/97 -- S. Schaffner
	CLHEP directory structure migration.
	Add setValidRange to TrkRecoTrk and TrkRep (default implementation).  
	Make extendThrough() return a TrkErrCode.  Both still have to be 
	implemented for KalRep.

7/11/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Still fiddling with Pocas.  Increase # of tiny steps to trip
	oscillation trap; decrease size of tiny step to
	0.5*precision(); correct the calculation in the event of a
	trip (and return after calculation is done).

7/7/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Two bug fixes in TrkPoca.cc and TrkDifPoca.cc: 1) extend step size by 
	epsilon, so searches don't stall on kinks; 2) choose direction before 
	testing for stopping stepping.

6/4/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Make HotLists be owned by TrkReps instead of TrkRecoTrks; Reps
	now have a ptr to their track, and have a single ctor.
	Make HotList ctor take AList of Hots as input (and make the
	ctor do the cloning).
	Rep now has massHypo() instead of defaultParticle().
	Remove TrkRep::cloneHots().
	TrkHitOnTrk now points to TrkRep, not TrkRecoTrk.
	TrkHitOnTrk::setUsed() invocation also moved to base class.
	Test for setUsed() and setUnused() invocations: only apply if rep's 
	hypo == track's default hypo.
	Change TrkHitOnTrk::getRep() to parentRep() and massHypo() to 
	particleType().


6/27/97 -- S. Schaffner
  	MomentumErr() implemented.

6/26 -- S. Schaffner
	Changed GNUmakefile to get dependencies from link_all_reco.mk. 
	Also was going to fix include in TrkSimpTraj but someone has done 
	it already.

6/24 -- S. Schaffner
Bug fix:
  TrkHitOnTrks were not cleaning up after themselves properly in their 
    dtor, iff the rep they were pointing to had a different particle type 
    than the track's default, _and_ was in fact pointed to by the track 
    as the default (this can only happen when a single rep is used for 
    multiple hypotheses).  Fixed the test in TrkHitOnTrk, and added 
    TrkHitOnTrk as friend to TrkRecoTrk to implement.

6/24 -- S. Schaffner
Modifications to permit return of error matrices on position, etc, from 
  RecoTrk.  Rewrote TrkParams to inherit for difAlgebra/DifIndepPar (also 
  rewritten for this purpose).
Implemented positionErr() and directionErr() in TrkRecoTrk.  MomentumErr() 
  is no longer commented out, but is not yet implemented.  

6/16 -- S. Schaffner
Bug fixes:
  Copy isValid and isCurrent flags in TrkRecoTrk::copyReps.
  Increment _nActive in TrkHotList ctor.

6/12 -- S. Schaffner
Add fitNumber() to TrkRecoTrk (counts number of times a fit has been 
        carried), along with data member and function in TrkRep 
        to support it.  All TrkReps hand off their current number to 
        successors.  TrkRecoTrk increments when fitting or swapping reps.
Switch to PdtPid::PidType from TrkPart::type.
Change TrkRecoTrk::removeHot to removeHit.

6/9 -- S. Schaffner
Move hitList deletion to TrkFundHit from derived classes (fixed Svt and Dch).

5/30/97 -- S. Schaffner
Create (from Gautier) TrkPart, and remove trkMassHypo.hh.
Switch to using TrkPart throughout.
Move invocation of setUnusedHit to base class (TrkHitOnTrk) dtor (temporarily 
        commented out).  (Now uncommented: 6/4).
Removed TrkFundHit::makeHot() (and from derived classes): no longer needed, 
   since TrkRecoTrk::appendHit() is gone.  Might need it again someday, if
   a user has a list of hits to add to a track without knowing what they are.
Remove KalHit as friend of TrkHitOnTrk.

5/26/97 -- S. Schaffner
Trajectory: 
  remove step().
TrkRecoTrk:
  remove appendHit, appendList(hit).
  move fltToRad to TrkHelixUtil, changing to return 3-d length instead of 2-d.

5/23/97 -- S. Schaffner
TrkRecoTrk:
  Remove pz().
  Fix printAll() (replace ostr << *this with print(ostr)).
  Fix printing of "is 2-d".
  Fix cloneHots to really clone hots.

TrkHitOnTrk:
  Add pure virtual getGTrack().

TrkPoca:
  Split into TrkPoca and TrkDifPoca, and add distance to point to both.
  Change calling sequence.

TrkExchangePar:
  Default covariance to zero.
  Add non-const access to covariance.

TrkRep:
  Add virtual const traj() (to existing non-const version).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Lots of other stuff happens . . .]

13 Nov96: Now works with modified version of DchReco.  Performance the same 
            as old DchReco except for small changes in z-fits -- probably 
            due to coincident change to 3-d path-length.  Implementation of 
            hits as Trajs still to be done (among other things).

1  Nov96: Add sketchy HelixRep.  Compiles.   (sschaff -- until further notice)

30 Oct 96: First compilable version. (sschaff)
