01/15/10 - R. Stroili
	split code in src and include directories

09/20/07 - I. Gaponenko
	CLHEP migration: replaced forward declarations with direct includes
	of the corresponding headers. Tag as V01-05-06.

11/20/06 - A. De Silva
	Fixes for gcc 3.4.6.

03/20/02 - W. Ford
	Modify call to pieceDFTraj.append(-5,testTraj22,gap); to conform
	to modification of that function's signature.

01/30/01 - E. Charles 
        Fix include path for BFieldFixed in test program.

10/17/00 - S. Wagner

10/05/00 - S. Wagner
        Move HelixTraj, NeutParams, NeutTraj, TrkCompTrk, TrkHelixUtils, 
        TrkMomCalculator, TrkMomVisitor to TrkBase; leave behind forwarding
        headers.
03/13/00 - J. Albert
        Changes in regard to removal of dynamic allocation of _dtparams
        in TrkBase/TrkSimpTraj.

12/08/99 - G. Raven
        Remove protection against going out of trajectory range
        in HelixTraj::distTo[1st|2nd]Error: 
           a) this kills TrkHitAdd right now
           b) it changes the behaviour of HelixTraj. It should either
              be changed in ALL trajectory classes, or NONE.

11/20/99 - J. Albert
        Added protection against going out of trajectory range in
        HelixTraj::distTo[1st|2nd]Error.

04/27/99 - S. Gowdy
	Remove include of SvtHit from TrkBmSomething.
	Updated dependencies.

04/05/99 - S. Schaffner
	More optimizations.  Implemented getDFInfo2() for Circle and Helix.
	Small optimizations to Helix::getDFInfo2 -- now almost unreadable.
	Similar changes to HelixFitter to get rid of temporaries.  Fixed 
	chisq convergence criterion in HelixFitter.

02/19/99 - S. Schaffner
	Turned off the reference-point shifting.  Added a number of 
	speed optimizations to the trajectory classes.  Removed 
	updateMeasurement() from HelixFitter (now done in updateFitStuff).
	Modified HelixFitter to use RW list of Hots.

02/03/99 - S. Schaffner
	Modify TrkHelixFitter to move trajectory reference point to first hit 
	on track before fitting, and then move it back afterwards

1/11/99  - S. Schaffner
	Moved TrkVisitor to TrkBase.

1/7/99   - S. Schaffner
	Moved TrkGeomTrajVisitor to BbrGeom, TrkPieceLineTraj, 
	TrkTransformVisitor, TrkLineTraj to TrajGeom.

11/20/98 - S. Schaffner
	Store TrkIdManager as base class, not derived class, in TrkContextEv.

11/19/98 - S. Schaffner
	Add test of BbrHelixTraj to testTrkFitter.  Add protected print 
	statements to TrkMomCalculator.  Implement faster access functions 
	(position(), getInfo()) in HelixTraj.  Switch to using base class 
	op=() in various trajectory classes.

11/6/98  - S. Schaffner
	ErrLogger migration.

11/5/98  - S. Schaffner
	Change some abs() to fabs() here and there.  Mods to 
	TrkMomCalculator: protect against sqrt(-), switch to using 
	nominal field instead of field at the point, remove position args.

10/30/98 - S. Schaffner
	Add protection in TrkHelixFitter against doing any calculations 
	with Hots whose updateFitStuff has failed.  Remove inheritence of 
	TrkIdManDefault from AbsEvtObj (the base class already inherits).

10/29/98 - S. Schaffner
	Speed up TrkHelixFitter: only updateMeasurement on first iteration; 
	cache derivs.

10/8/98 - S. Schaffner
	Fix bugs in NeutTraj: 
	  distTo1stErr and 2ndErr were both zero, should have been 
	     large numbers;
	  x() and y() both left out a factor of cosDip().
	Also speeded up position() calculation.

10/5/98 - R.Faccini
        *  Modify constructor of TrkCompTrk to allow for XP covariance matrix
        *  add   TrkHelixUtils::lineFromMomErr
        *  add getAllWeights(HepPoint...) to all classes deriving from 
           TrkAbsFit    
9/24/98 - S. Schaffner
	Remove CircleParams.  It's a trend.

9/?/98  - S. Schaffner
	Remove HelixParams, and all traces of it.  Interpretation of the 
	entries in TrkParams is now the job of HelixTraj.
          
9/14/98 - S. Schaffner
	Add missing function implementations (nSvt, nDch, nActive) to 
	TrkDeadRep.

9/8/98  - S. Schaffner
	Added bfield to TrkCompTrk.  Made trajectories and bfield references 
	instead of pointers in TrkMomCalculator.  Implemented vertexing 
	functions for TrkCompTrk.

8/21/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Added derived classes for TrkContext (TrkContextCustom) and 
	TrkIdManager (TrkIDManDefault, TrkIDManDumb).

Release 6.10.0

7/22/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add cloning of hots to TrkSimpleRep copy ctor (moved here from 
	TrkRep).

7/20/98 -- J. Albert
        Added function helixFromMomErr in TrkHelixUtils, fixed TrkCompTrk
        constructor using this function, made it inherit from TrkAbsFit,
        and uncommented the class.

7/15/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Fix access functions in TrkMergeMap to handle empty map.

Release 6.9.0

7/7/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Modified TrkContextEv to accept anEvent == 0.

6/30/98 -- J. Albert 
        Established a Visitor pattern to calculate momentum from
        trajectories.  New classes added: TrkMomCalculator, TrkMomVisitor,
        and TrkVisitor.  Modified the SimpleTraj's to accept the visitor
        (Helix, Circle, Line and Neut, as well as Simple itself) by adding
        an accept function.  Modified TrkSimpleRep to use the momentum
        visitors.  Note: the Visitor pattern is described in the reference
        _Design Patterns_.

6/24/98 -- Schaffner
	Updated FitMakers to require and pass TrkContext.

Release 6.8.0

6/23/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Removed t0 from TrkContextEv.  Added t0 to Helix, Circle and Mini 
	Makers.

	Create derived class TrkContextEv -- can create TrkContext from 
	AbsEvent.
	
4/28/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove TrkPersistTrk.  Add TrkContext argument to TrkCircleMaker::
	makeTrack.

 4/2/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove default t0 argument in FitMakers.  Update to new location 
	of TrkViewInfo enum in TrkBase.

3/27/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add t0 as argument to all makeTrack() functions in FitMakers 
	(TrkHelixMaker, etc).  (Defaults to 0. during migration.)

3/27/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Moved TrkHelix from TrkDataP.

3/23/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Update to TrkRecoTrk split interface.

3/16/98 -- S. Schaffner	
	Make dtor NeutTraj dtor virtual.  Change TrkDeadMaker to permit 
	replacing an existing rep with a DeadRep.

 3/3/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add chisq data member to TrkSimpleRep, and stop using chisq in 
	TrkParams.

2/27/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add minimal protection against pt = 0 tracks in TrkHelixUtils.cc.

2/22/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Added TrkMergeMap; permits navigation from a merged track to the 
	two tracks that went into its creation (or any other 1->2 mapping 
	of tracks).

1/28/98 -- S. Schaffner
	Add TrkDeadRep: dummy TrkRep to represent a failed fit. Add 
	TrkDeadMaker to create them.

1/26/98  -- S. Schaffner
	Modify arguments to TrkHelixFitter::fit() to take AList of Hots, 
	rather than HotList.
	Add ctors to simple reps (and TrkSimpleRep) to handle creation 
	from set of values, without hit list.
	Added TrkMiniMaker -- factory for creating hitless helix reps -- 
	used for holding minimal track info.

1/6/98   -- S. Schaffner
	Removed set2d from trajs, since it's now in base class TrkFitStatus.

1/1/98   -- D. Brown
	Implementation of changes to changePar functions in trajs.

12/08/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Add dependence on BField package.  Change TrkBase/BField.hh to 
	BField/BField.hh everywhere.  Tagged as V00-04-16.

12/01/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Modify TrkLineParams.cc and TrkCircleParams.cc to handle change to 
	TrkExchangePar enum.

12/01/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Remove all fitNumber stuff from the Reps.

11/7/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Implement TransformVisitor for PieceLineTrajs.

11/6/97 -- S. Schaffner
	Modify LineTraj and PieceLineTraj to inherit from GeomTraj.  Create 
	visitor classes for GeomTrajs: TrkGeomTrajVisitor (base class) and 
	TrkTransformVisitor (to carry out coordinate transformations on 
	trajectories).  The latter is implemented only for line trajs 
	today (i.e. not for pieceLineTrajs).

11/3/97 -- Schaffner
	Handle changes to enums in TrkErrCode and TrkHelixParams.  Addition 
	(by Princeton students) of TrkNeutParams and TrkNeutTraj.

10/22/97 -- Schaffner
	Modify TrkHelixFitter to handle new return type of updateFitStuff.
	TrkHelixMaker no longer sets all Rep ptrs to default, since 
	TrkRecoTrk does it.

10/1/97 -- D. Brown
	Converted the concrete simptrajs to the new explicit reference point
	formulation (relatively minor changes, realy).  Only the HelixTraj
	has really been tested.  Added a (standalone) test program for testing
	the HelixTraj.

9/22/97 - S. Schaffner
	Implement nDof() for TrkSimpleRep.  Modify TrkHelixFitter to handle 
	changed definitions in TrkHitOnTrk.
9/15/97 - G. Sciolla
	Modify TrkHelixUtils::fltTroRad to handle omega = 0.

8/26/97 - S. Schaffner
	First implementation of delta-chi finding in TrkHelixFitter.cc.
	
8/21/97 - S. Schaffner

	Modify TrkHelixFitter's test on minimum number of hits required.  
	Reduce minimum to the minimum (to avoid losing Svt tracks) and 
	generalize to accomodate circle and line fits.

8/21/97 - S. Schaffner

	Cope with removal of weight matrix from TrkParams-derived classes.  
	Add TrkHelixMaker::setValidRange().  Update to new convention re 
	Trajectory ranges (non-infinite).

7/28/97 - S. Schaffner

	CLHEP directory structure migration.

7/18/97 - J. LoSecco

	Replaced obscure code in TrkHelixUtils for the helixFromMom
	function with cleaner better documented code.
	The equations come from
	R.~Luchsinger and C.~Grab, Comp.~Phys.~Comm.~{\bf 76}, 263-280 (1993).

7/16/97 - S. Schaffner

	Add support for straight-line fits: TrkDifLineTraj, TrkLineParams,
	TrkLineRep, TrkLineMaker.  TrkDifLineTraj.cc still needs to have the
	Kalman-style derivs implemented.  Finish tidying up TrkHelixFitter.cc
	to make it fully generic: now fits lines, helices, and circles
	automatically.

6/30/97 - S. Schaffner

	Bug fix -- kludge TrkHelixMaker to handle creation of TrkPersistTrks 
	(which are created without a Rep inside).

6/27/97 - S. Schaffner

	Modify params classes to use access functions for parameters -- now 
	works with recent change in TrkBase::TrkParams.
	Add code to normalize phi0 (in Helix and CircleParams) on output, in 
	the Reps and Trajs.

6/12/97 - S. Schaffner

	Implement fitNumber, as described in TrkBase history, in derived Rep 
	classes.
	Switch to PdtPid::PidType from TrkPart::type.

6/4/97 - S. Schaffner

	Modify Reps to fit new base class syntax.

5/23/97 - S. Schaffner

	Add tests of new Pocas to testTrkFitter.cc.  Add some commented out 
	lines in TrkHelixFitter.cc.
	Added TrkCircleParams, TrkCircleTraj, TrkCircleRep.
	Add TrkSimpleRep, as base class for TrkCircleRep and TrkHelixRep.
	Modify TrkHelixFitter to fit any simpleRep.
	Move hit-dropping and flipping flags from TrkHelixRep into 
	TrkHelixFitter.
	Remove same flags from TrkHelixMaker ctor, and add function 
	setFlipAndDrop to control.
	Migrate to BbrAngle::rad()
