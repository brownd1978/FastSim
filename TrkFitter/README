TrkFitter contains core classes for charged-particle tracking.  Most
of the classes here are concrete -- the abstract base classes are in
the TrkBase package.  In particular, it contains classes for all of
the simple track representations (circle, helix, line); this includes
parameter classes (e.g. TrkCircleParams), trajectories (TrkCircleTraj), 
TrkReps (TrkCircleRep), and factory classes to create them (TrkCircleMaker).

TrkFitter also contains utiliy code. It has support for a visitor
pattern in the geometric trajectories (TrkGeomTrajs), and one visitor
(TrkTransformVisitor) that applies a HepTransform to GeomTrajs.  There's 
also a utility class, TrkHelixUtils, for misc. functions relating to 
helices.
