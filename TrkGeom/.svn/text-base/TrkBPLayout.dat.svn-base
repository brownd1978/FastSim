#
#  Test version of beampipe data file; this
#  creates a 4-segment beampipe, according
#  to Bill Dunwoodies BAD note 106
#  updated to 'model' the B1 magnets as 4cm of steel
#  (dnb 5/13/02)
#
#  A few more notes, especially on the radii
#  and thickness.
#   - throughout the beampipe, the inner radius does not
#     change.
#
#   - The thickness of the material is only used to get the material
#     properties right. That is, the interaction and radiation lengths.
#   
#   - the material names are defined in MatEnv/MaterialsList_IR2.data
