#  Test version of support tube data file; this
#  creates a 1-segment tube.
#
# order of numbers:
#	1) number of tubular elements
#	2) number of segments
#	then a loop over the number of elements:
#	3) radii of the tubes
#	for each element there are n segments;
#	and therefore loop over the number segments for this element:
#	3a) thicknesses of the material
#	3b) material description of the segments
#	3c) low z-ends of this segment
#	3d) high z-ends of is segment
