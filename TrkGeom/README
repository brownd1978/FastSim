This package defines the transient representation of the general 
tracking system features (beampipe and support tube) as used in reconstruction.


History:

02 Jan 2003 David Norvil Brown (V00-01-12)
	Add a #include of tpslist.h to TrkPassive.hh to restore 
	compilation in downstream package TrkGeomP.

30 Dec 2002 David Norvil Brown (V00-01-11)
	Propagated last of the DetectorModel RW migrations.  This mostly
	affects classes derived from DetType and DetElem, where numerous
	Rw lists, vectors, strings, and booleans were migrated to std 
	versions.  

16 Dec 2002 David Norvil Brown (V00-01-10)
	Propagated RW migration in DetectorModel.

10 Aug 2001 Johan Blouw (V00-00-04)
	Committed changes by Dave Brown and Johan Blouw to optimize
	description of support tube and svt shields. 

7 Aug 2001, Johan Blouw (V00-00-034
	Both the Support Tube and the Svt shields are now coded in a way
	similar to the beampipe. TrkPassive has been updated accordingly.
	Two new classes have been introduced: TrkSTLayout and TrkSvtSLayout
	for the support tube and the svt shields, respectively.
	Note that the geometry descriptions are on TrkSvtSLayout.dat and 
	TrkSTLayout.dat. Inconsitencies with ErrLogger have been removed.
	(The ErrMsg routine requires to use of endmsg instead of endl.)

20 July 2001, Johan Blouw (V00-00-03)
	Committed changes to TrkBPLayout.dat and TrkBPType concerning
	the geometry of the beampipe (now 4 sections, see BAD 106) and
	some extra output from TrkBPType.

12 July 2001, Johan Blouw (V00-00-02)
	Committed changes made by Dave N. Brown to allow for
	beampipe consisting of multiple parts.

12 July 2001, Johan Blouw (V00-00-01)
	Dave Brown and Johan Blouw instantiated package. It provides
    	TrkEnv with the geometry of the beampipe and support tube.
	TrkGeom follows the SvtGeom example.
