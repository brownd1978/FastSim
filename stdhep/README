   Product name : STDHEP
       Versions : V3_00
 Product Number : PM0091
           Date : 26-Jul-1995
  Origin/Author : Lynn Garren, Paul Lebrun
     Maintainer : Lynn Garren
  Support Level : 5*

Description:
   STDHEP contains a set of translation routines which convert
   Herwig, Jetset, Isajet, or QQ events to and from the standard
   HEP event format.  STDHEP also contains utility routines
   to work with the HEPEVT common block and a set of I/O routines.
   The HEPEVT common block allows 4000 particles per event.

   The translation of Xi_c and Xi_b particles has changed with version
   2.01.  Also, the read/write routines changed with version 2.01.  
   A bug was found in the 2.x read/write routines.  That bug was
   fixed in version 3.00.  Please use stdrepair on old I/O files.
   This version is not backwards compatible.

   Mcfio, an xdr I/O interface package, is included with stdhep.

Usage:
   % setup cern
   % setup lund
   % setup stdhep
   % f77 -o myprog myprog.f \
        $LULIB/ludata.o $LULIB/pydata.o \
        $STDHEP_DIR/lib/libstdhep.a $LULIB/liblund.a $CRNLIB/libpacklib.a

Modification history:
---------------------

V03-00-09
  include/hep2geant.inc moved from src/.

V03-00-08

V03-00-07

V03-00-06 07-Oct-1998 Lockman
  copy beget/hep2geant.F to stdhep/hep2geant.F. Bogus shouldnt need this 
  routine.

V03-00-05  7/31/98

  New subroutine stdtranslate.F added.  (Abi Soffer)

10/03/97 P. Kim

  Hep2geant.F renamed to hep2geant.F.nocompile
  It calls gsvert and gskine in Geant3, so makes the stdhep library 
  incompatible with Bogus.  BBSIM picks up hep2geant from beget anyway.  

10/02/97 P. Kim
 
  Replaced hep2geant.F  with  (hep2geant.F / hep2geant.inc) from Beget.
  Stdhep Version 3.0 changed PHEP and VEHP in stdhep.inc to double precision.
  Torre made protection against the problem of calling GSKINE with double
  precision argument, in hep2geant.F in the Beget package which we use in 
  BBSIM.  Bogus does not use Beget, but links to the stdhep library via 
  DbiEvent, so it is now necessary to fix hep2geant.F in stdhep.  

7/23/96 T. Wenaus
- clean up duplicate stdhep.inc files. Single copy now in include/stdhep.inc
- suppress stdrepair main program from compilation/library
- suppress unresolved references in building C++ codes referencing STDHEP
4/12/96 T. Wenaus
- make mods to build the STDHEP XDR I/O code used by McFIO
  - modify src/GNUmakefile to compile *.c
  - fix includes in src/mcf_Stdhep_xdr.c
