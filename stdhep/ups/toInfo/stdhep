STDHEP 2.03 is now available as current.

STDHEP 2.03 is not backwards compatible.  This version was created with 
common blocks from HERWIG 5.8, ISAJET 7.09, LUND 7.04, and QQ 9.0.

Modifications:

      Add QQ translation routines QQHEP and QQTRAN.

      Fix a minor bug in ISTRAN, which translated states not known to ISAJET.

      Add HEP2GEANT to fill geant KINE structure (supplied by Doug Wright).

      Clean up the definitions of heavy quark cascade particles.

      Add general utility routines to get daughter lists, etc.

      Modify generic read/write routines HEPRD and HEPWRT to use
      identifying labels for each output record.

      Add HEPRDM to allow multiple input streams.

      Add routines to get and read/write some begin and end run information.

      Modify stdhep.inc to contain only the HEPEVT and HEPEV2 common blocks.
      Stdlun.inc contains the HEPLUN common block.

The manual, PM0091, is available from the Fermilab Computing Department 
Program Librarian.  A postscript version is included in the product
distribution.
